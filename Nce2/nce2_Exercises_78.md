For how long did the writer give up smoking?

After reading an article entitled ' Cigarette Smoking and Your Health' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves.
I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette.
For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered terribly.
I has all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite.
My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars.
They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket
After seven days of this I went to party.
Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable.
When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear.
I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction.
My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more.
Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.
He himself has done it lots of times!

Two young boys who had never smoked before wanted to try.
One evening, after they had their supper, Father went into the living-room to watch TV, leaving a packet of cigarettes on the table.
The boys took two cigarettes from the packet and went out of the house secretly.
They hid in the garage, hoping to enjoy their smoking there.
However, when they lit the cigarettes and began to smoke, they could not help coughing, because the smoke was too strong for them.
Their father somehow saw the smoke coming form the garage, and rushed down quickly.
But when he saw the boys there, he smiled.
Instead of criticizing them, he offered them cigars and asked them to have a taste.
The boys accepted them. But the cigars were even stronger than the cigarettes.
When they smoked, they both felt very sick and coughed badly.
This was a punishment for them.
