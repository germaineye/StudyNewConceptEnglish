The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree'.

The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation.
It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he wil die.
Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims.
The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused.
He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it.
