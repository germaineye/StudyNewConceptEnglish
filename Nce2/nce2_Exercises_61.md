What is the special importance of a telescope in sapce?
The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at a cost of over billion dollars.
Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble.
The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty!
NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it.
The shuttle *Endeavour* will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble.
A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs.
Of course, the Hubble is above the earth's atmosphere, so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen.
The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.
By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

## Summary writing

When the Hubble telescope was launched into sapce on April, 20, 1990, the pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty.
The four astronauts from the Endeavour will be making necessary repairs the telescope ,and eventually, the prictures from the Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.

## Composition

There was trouble with the Hubble right from the start.
The main mirror was faulty, so the pictures it sent us were very disappointing.
Now the shuttle 'Endeavour' will be takings four astronausts to make the necessary repairs the Hubble.
It will soon send the clearest pictures  of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen.

## Letter writing

I have not heard from you for some time, so....
It was very kind of you to...

Exercise

Dear Peter:

        I have not heard from you for some time, so I write to you.
I am going to visit your city next week.

Dear Jack:
