In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for twenty-one-mile tunnel under the English Channel.
He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the entre of the Channel.
This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.
The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level.
In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman,Willian Low.
He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.
This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.
Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun.
If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed.
The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.
It was officially opened on March 7, 1994, finally connecting Britian to the European continent.

经典演讲赏析： Al Gore's Speech
Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged（陷入沼泽） down in Iraq;
we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him;
we would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis;
we would be fighting for middle-income families;
we would not be showing contempt for the Constitution;
we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or
sexual orientation;
and we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving the climate crisis.
总结一句话： If I had been elected the president, we wouldn’t have made so many mistakes and
America would be much better now.

## Summary writing

The tunnel,which the French engineer,Aime Thome, planned to build under the English Channel in 1858, would be ventilated by tall chimneys built above sea level.
An Englishman,William Low suggested a better plan two years later.
Passing trains solve the problem of ventilation in his proposed double railway-tunnel because they would draw in fresh air behind them.
Though work began forty-two years later,it was stopped because the British had feared invasion.
However, the Channel Tunnel officially was opened on March,7,1994.
