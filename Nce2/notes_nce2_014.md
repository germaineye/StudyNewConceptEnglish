## Part 2  Key Structures

1. **After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on  to the next town.**  
      - 1）复习第７课，过去完成时的核心思维： 过去的过去  
            　强化：过去完成时是回望“过去的过去”， 一定要先有一个过去的时间或动作。  
            这句话中“过去动作”是 drove on 继续开车  
            “过去的过去”就是 “had left a small village”。  
            在我上大学之前，我已经学会电脑编程。  
            Before I went to college, I had learned coding skills.  
            过去=went to college ,过去的过去=had learned）  
            到了 2016 年的年底，我们已经有 100 万用户了。  
            By the end of 2016, we had had 1 million users. （过去= the end of 2016)  
            *总结： 过去完成时="过去的过去"*  
            1) 使用场合 1：描述先后发生的两个过去的动作  
            2) 使用场合 2：描述过去时间点之前完成的事 （可以和过去时间连用）  
2. **As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.**  
      - 1） as soon as 表示“一...就”= immediately after  
            时态上，如果强调先后，可以用过去完成时，但不是必须。  
            因为 as soon as 连接的两个动作相隔比较近，有时几乎是同时发生。  
            昨晚一直在复习考试。  I was cramming for the exam last night.
            我太累了，头刚碰到枕头，我就睡着了。  
            I was so exhausted. As soon as my head touched the pillow, I just fell asleep.  
      - 2） 上/下车的表达：口语 hop in the car / hop out of the car  
            hop in / hop out 上车/下车  
            Every one could hop out, it's the terminus（终点站） .  
            到国外旅行，有种巴士叫 Hop On Hop Off Bus。就是旅游大巴，可以买个套票，然后就可以在任何站点上车或下车。
3. **Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey.**  
      - 1）apart from 两个用法：  
            ＝except for 除了…外，都没有...  
            Apart from America, I have never been to any foreign countries.  
            除了美国，其它海外国家我都没去过。  
            ＝in addition to; as well as　除了…外（还）；此外；加之  
            Apart from America, I have been to many countries.   
            除了美国，还去过很多国家。
            Apart from swimming, he does not like any sports.  除了游泳，他什么运动都不喜欢。  
            除了游泳，他还喜欢打网球。  
            Apart from swimming, he also likes playing tennis.= In addition to swimming, he also likes playing tennis.  
      - 2）两者都不 neither of us／两者都 both of us  
            Both of us will have Chinese noodles.  
            Nope(口语=No). But neither of us likes fried chicken . 但是我们都不喜欢吃炸鸡。

## Part 3 Reporting 转述

      场景想象：    
            在英语⻆上，你碰到了⼀个⽼外，你们聊起语⾔学习的趣事。你想到你的⼀个英国朋友Oliver,他曾经在法国的⼀次有趣经历。  于是你聊起了Oliver的故事。  
            我的⼀个英国朋友给我讲过他的⼀个有趣经历。  
            去年，他在法国南部驾⻋旅⾏。  
            在他游览过⼀个⼩村庄之后，他继续⾃⼰的旅程驶向下⼀个城镇。  
            当他正在路上驾⻋⾏驶， Oliver看到了⼀个年轻⼈正向他招⼿。  
            所以，他停下了⻋，年轻⼈向Oliver请求搭⻋。  
            Oliver答应了他的请求，于是这个⼈就上了⻋。  
            这个年轻⼈刚⼀上⻋， Oliver就⽤法语跟他打招呼，⽽这个年轻⼈同样⽤法语回答。  
            但是其实， Oliver除了类似你好这样的法语之外，⼏乎不会法语。  (“bonjour”and “salut”.)  
            在整个旅途中Oliver和他的乘客都没有说话    
            在整个旅途中Oliver和他的乘客都没有说话。  【neither A nor B，表示A和B都不: Neither my sister nor I likes horror movies.】  
            我肯定Oliver⼀定在想：我的法语太差劲了，我⽆法和他对话。  
            他们就要到达⽬的地了，那年轻⼈令⼈意外地开⼝了，语速很慢地说： “你会讲英⽂吗？ ”  
            Oliver很快就了解到，这个年轻⼈也来⾃英格兰。  
            我猜那个年轻⼈⼀定也想知道是否Oliver也是英国⼈，因为Oliver说法语时带着浓重的英国⼝⾳。  [with a strong English accent.带着浓重的英国⼝⾳]  

### 转述英语全文  
            My English friend Oliver once told me about his funny experience.  
            Last year, he was driving in the south France.  
            After he had visited a small village, he drove on to the next town.  
            As he was driving on the road,  Oliver saw a young man waving to him.  
            So he stopped his car,  and the young man asked Oliver for a lift / ride.  
            Oliver accepted his request and the man got into the car.
            As soon as the young man had  got on the car, Oliver greeted  him in French and the young man replied in the same language.  
            But actually, Oliver only  knew a litter French except for  a few words, such as "bonjour" and "salut".  
            Neither Oliver nor his passenger spoke during the journey.  
            I am sure Oliver must have been thinking:"My French is so poor that I can't  talk to him.  
            They had nearly reached the  destination, when the young man unexpectedly said, very slowly: " do you speak English?"  
            As Oliver soon learned, the young man was  also from England.  
            I guess the young man must have been wondering  if Oliver was English, because Oliver spoke French with a strong Enlish accent.  

### 文化拓展  

      ⼊乡随俗  
      俗话说，⼊乡随俗。
      Do in Rome as the Romans do.  
      在外国，尊重别⼈的语⾔和⽂化是⼀个特别重要的事。
      It is of vital importance to respect local culture and people.
      ⽽说当地的语⾔就是对当地⼈和当地⽂化的尊重。  
      Speaking local language is a way of showing your respect to local culture and people.  
      记得Facebook的创始⼈Mark Zuckerberg曾在2010年开始学习中⽂， 4年后访问清华⼤学时，全程1⼩时坚持⽤中⽂演讲，虽然他的中⽂带有浓重的美国⼝⾳，但是这样的⽅式让他在中国圈粉⽆数。他实际在传递⼀个信息：  
      I can speak your language because I know your culture and respect your culture.  
      所以，语⾔不仅仅是⼀种沟通⼯具，也是⽂化和情感的载体。  
      Language is not just a tool of communication， but a carrier of culture and emotions.   
      对我们很多同学⽽⾔，学习英⽂就是打开世界的窗户。  
      English is the window to the world.  
      公共场合要用大家都听得懂的语言交流
