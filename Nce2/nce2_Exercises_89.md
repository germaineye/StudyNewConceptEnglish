Who made the only funny joke that evening and why?

People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one.
When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company,We all rushed to see it.
We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.
Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.
Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.
The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme.
He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.
As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing.
We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually said was:'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company.
Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!'

1. People *will do anything to see* a free show -- even if it is a bad one.
    三个“竭尽全力” 的经典表达：  
    1） do anything to do ...  
    2） make every effort to do ...  
    3） spare no effort to do / in doing

    **同位语从句中， that 后面是*一个完整句子***  
    同位语从句句型就是： 名词 + that + 同位语从句（一个完整的陈述句）  
    注意： 前面需要解释的名词往往表示客观信息， 或人的感受， 比如 news, message, idea， fact ,truth, feeling , thought 等。  
    “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”

3. 情态动词+have 两大功能是什么？  
     ...there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.   
     Those whofailed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.  
    1） 对过去的推测：

        当时肯定....， must have done

## Summary writing

    The local cinema was packed because the P & U Bird Seed Company was presenting a free comedy show.

The funniest thing we heard came at the beginning from the advertiser who introduced the programme saying,'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company.Good ladies,evening and gentlemen!'

B

    The local cinema was packed. The P & U Bird Seed Company was presenting a free comedy show but many of the artistes who should have appeared failed to turn up. Because of this, the show was very dull. The funniest thing we heard came at the beginning from the advertiser who introduced the programme saying,'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company.

## Composition

    Yesterday afternoon, a comedy show was given at our local cinema by the P & U Bird Seed Company. Before the show began, there was already a long queue of people outside, but many of them failed to come in. Fortunately the show was one of the dullest ones. So they were the lucky ones.

    There was a bare stage with only a microphone in the middle and an ugly model of a yellow bird beside it. And some free packets of bird seed were prepared for the audience. The only funny thing about the show was the advertiser. As he was too nervous to speak, he stood awkwardly before the microphone for some minutes. As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing. The audience knew what he should have said, though he kept making mistakes. The rest of the show was not as amusing as the audience had expected, so they felt somewhat disappointed.
