      场景想象：  
           你在和一个外国朋友聊天，聊到有些特别吝啬(mean)小气(cheap)的人．　你想到，你的表弟Kevin有一位特别小气，喜欢占便宜的朋友Tony．　　
           于是你给这位外国朋友聊Tony的故事．  

           我的表弟Kevin有一个朋友叫Tony．这个家伙特别喜欢占别人便宜．（sponge on sb.就是揩油的意思)  
           Tony 多年前曾在一家律师事务所上班，现在在一家银行上班．  
           尽管Tony 的薪水很高，但他常常向朋友借钱.  
           借钱没什么问题，但是你知道为什么我表弟很讨厌Tony?  
           因为他从来欠朋友的钱都不还.  
           有一天, Kevin在一家非常好的餐厅吃晚餐，猜猜他遇见了谁?  
           对了，他遇到了Tony．Tony看见了我表弟，向他走云，然后和Kevin坐在同一张桌子边．  
           我想Kevin心里一定非常担忧，因为Tony从来没有向他借过钱．  
           因此, Kevin决定先下手为强．  
           不等Tony开口向他借钱，Kevin提出向Tony借20英镑.  
           Kevin 认为，这样相当于告诉Tony 他没钱．  
           令人惊讶的是，Tony立刻就答应了Kevin的请求.  (accept one's request答应要求)  
           然而, Tony后来要求Kevin为他付晚饭钱作来回报．
           Tony肯定是一个小事精明，大事糊涂的人．  


### 转述英语全文  

      My cousin Kevin had a friend called This guy likes sponging on  others.  
      Tony used to work for  a lawyer's office several years ago and is working at a bank now.
      Even though Tony has a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends.  
      It is ok to borrow money, but do you know why my cousin hates Tony?    
      Because he never pays  back the money he owes his friends  
      One day, Kevin was having dinner at a  very nice restaurant and guess  who he met?  
      Yes, he met  Tony.  
      Tony saw my cousin and walked to him and sat at the same table with Kevin.  
      I think Kevin must have been very anxious, because Tony had never borrowed any money from him.  
      So Kevin decided to make the  first move.  
      Instead of waiting for Tony to borrow money from him, Kevin asked  Tony to lend  him 20 pounds.  
      In this way,  Kevin thought he was telling Tony he did not have any  money.  
      Surprisingly, Tony accepted Kevin's request immediately.  
      Howerver, Tony then asked Kevin to pay for his dinner in return
      Indeed, Tony must be penny wise and pound foolish.
