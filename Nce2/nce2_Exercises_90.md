它们是什么鱼?

油煎鱼加炸土豆片一直是英国人喜爱的一道菜，但是随着海洋里的滥捕滥捞，鱼已经变得越来越昂贵。
因此，听说北海石油钻井平台上的潜水员受到巨型鱼类的恐吓，确实很让人吃惊。钻井平台需要经常修理，
潜水员常常要在水面 100 英尺以下摸黑工作，他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的大鱼吓得惊惶失措。现在
他们有了特制的笼子，用来保护他们免受大鱼的侵袭。这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或逆戟鲸，而是深受人们喜爱的
食用鱼品种，如鳕鱼和鳐鱼，只不过它们长得出奇地大，有时长达 12 英尺。这些鱼能长得这么大是由 3
个因素造成的：海底热的输油管道附近的温暖的海水；钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物；钻井平台
周围根本没有捕鱼船只。结果是，这些鱼就在可爱的温暖的水流中吃呀吃，长呀长。究竟谁吃谁呢？

What kind of fish are they?

Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive.
So it comes as surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs.
Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.
Now they have had special cages made to protect them form these monsters.
The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length.
Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who cats who?

    the second is the supply of plentiful food;
    the third is the absence of fishing around the rigs.

## Composition

    Now I want to tell you a strange story which I heard from the divers during our visit. The divers had to work at a depth of sixty feet under water. At first, their work went on well. But some time later, one diver reported that he got a nasty bump in the dark, and all the divers were frightened out of their wits. As a result, they dared not go on with their work. This sounded like a joke. Upon hearing this, the men on the rigs all laughed. They thought there must be a monster in the deep ocean.

    Then, a second team went down. But they came up immediately, for they were again bumped by some giant creature as they worked. It turned out to be some huge fish: a cod eight feet it length, and a skate twelve feet across. So the divers refused to go down again. The managers had to promise to have special cages made to protect them.
