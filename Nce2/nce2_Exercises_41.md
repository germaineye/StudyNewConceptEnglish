# Lesson 41 Do you call that a hat?

“你把那个叫帽子吗?” 我对妻子说.
“你说话没必要这样不客气, “我的妻子边回答边照着镜子.
我坐在一个新式的满是网眼儿的椅子上, 等待着. 我们在这家帽店已经呆了半个小时了, 而我的妻子
仍在镜子面前.
“我们不应该买我们不需要的东西, “我突然发表意见说, 但马上又后悔说了这话.
“你没必要这么说, “我妻子回答说, “我也不必提醒你昨天买的那条糟糕透了的领带. “
“我觉得它好看, “我说, “男人有多少领带也不会嫌多. “
“女人有多少帽子也不嫌多. “她回答.
10 分钟以后, 我们一道走出了商店. 我妻子戴着一顶像灯塔一样的帽子.

 'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.
 'You needn't be so rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.
 I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. 
 We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.
 'We musn't buy things we don't need,' I remarked suddenly. 
 I regretted saying it almost at once.
 'You needn't have said that,' my wife answered. 'I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.'
 'I find it beautiful ,' I said. ' A man can never have too many ties.'
 'And a woman can't have too many hats,' she answered.
 Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together.
 My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!

My wife not only has too many hats but too many dresses as well.
We have been invited to a party this evening but she does not want to go.
She keeps looking at at all those dresses and saying,'I haven't got anything to wear!'
