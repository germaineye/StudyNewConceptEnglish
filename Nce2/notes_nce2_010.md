## Part 3 Reporting 转述

      场景想象：  
           你和一个朋友聊天，谈到一个乐器．你想到你的朋友Susan家有个古钢琴，但是最近被弄坏的故事．　
           于是你说:  
           My friend Susan once told me a story about an old musical instrument in her family.  
           这个乐器叫古钢琴，是300年前由德国制造的．  
           它看上去像一台小型的钢琴，在18世纪的欧洲非常流行 .  
           Susan的祖父在多年以前买了这个乐器．他们家已经拥有这件乐器很久了．  
           所以，它一定是一件非常贵重的乐器，它被存放在客厅里． 
           然后，最近它被损坏了．为什么呢?  
           一个客人用它来弹奏爵士乐，结果两根琴弦断了．   
           显然，在一个古钢琴上弹奏爵士乐是件很糟糕的做法． 
           为什么呢？因为古钢琴过去主要是用作练习乐器，声音不大，并不适合作大型演出．  
           那位客人显然不知道这一点，所以她很用力敲击琴键，试图发出很大的声音．  
           此外，这件乐器造于几百年前．因此，肯定也是非常容易坏的．  (very fragile 非常容易坏的)    
           最后发生了什么？  
           当Susan的爸爸知道这件贵重的乐器损坏了，他震惊了．  
           那就是为什么现在这件乐器不允许碰了．她父亲的一个朋友正在维修．  

### 转述英语全文  

      The musical instrument is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany over 300 years ago  
      It looks like a small piano and  was very popular in Europe during the 18st century.  
      Susan's grandfather bought it  many years ago and her family has owned  the clavichord for a very  long time.  
      So  it must be very valuabel instrument and it is kept in the living room.  
      However, It was damaged recently, How come / why?  
      A visitor was  trying to play jazz on it . As a result,  two strings were broken.  
      Obviously,  it is not good idea to play jazz on a clavichord.  
      Why? Because the clavichord was mostly used as a practice instrument ,  and it was not loud enough for  large performances.  
      Clearly the visitor did not know this , so she was trying to make louder sounds by striking the keys very hard.  
      Apart from that, this old musical instrument was made several  hundreds years ago , so It must have  been very fragile.  
      What happened in the end?    
      When Susan's father learned the precious instrument was damaged, he was shocked.  
      That's why touching the clavichord isn't  allowed now. A friend of her farther's is repairing it.
