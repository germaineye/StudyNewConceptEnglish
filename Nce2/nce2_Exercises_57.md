一位穿着牛仔裤的妇女站在一家高档商店的橱窗前. 她虽然犹豫了片刻, 但终于还是走进了商店, 要
求把陈列在橱窗里的一件衣服拿给她看. 接待她的售货员不喜欢她的那副打扮, 轻蔑地看了她一眼后, 便
告诉她那件衣服已经卖出去了. 这位妇女怒气冲冲地走出了商店, 决定第二天教训一下那个售货员. 第二
天上午, 她又来到这家商店, 穿了一件裘皮大衣, 一只手拎着一只手提包, 另一只手拿着一把长柄伞. 找到
那个无礼的售货员后, 她还要看昨天的那件衣服. 那个售货员没有认出她是谁, 这一回接待她的态度非常
殷勤. 费了好大劲几, 他爬进橱窗去取那件衣服. 这位妇女对那件衣服只看一眼, 就说不喜欢. 她开心地迫

A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop. Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed. Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.
