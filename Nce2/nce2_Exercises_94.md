What kind of race do the children compete in?
Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age. At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water. It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycle are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water. The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them. Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they gasping for air.

## Key tructures

1. 如何摆事实， 讲道理？  
    我们之前学习的课文多数在学如何讲故事 (how to tell a story)，  
    而这篇文章的重点是学习如何阐述观点 (How to make a point)。  
    If you want to make your point convincing, you need to show evidence.  
    全文结构解析：
    论点: Key point  
        “Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age.”  
    论据： What are the facts that support the conclusion mentioned in the first sentence ?  
        1） First of all, children are able to hold their breath under water before they can walk.  
        2） In addition, two-month-old babies soon get used to swimming, and can even pick up weights  
        from the bottom of a swimming pool.  
        3） Finally , underwater tricycle race shows the great potential of these young swimmers.  
    结尾 Comment:  
        We will wait and see whether they will become future Olympic champions.  
    **如何表达结论和观点句型：**  
        1） Experiments have proved that+结论___表达实验证明
        2） Numerous studies show that +结论___诸多研究显示  
        3） According to a recent survey, +结论__结论来自一项调查  
        4） There is ample evidence that +结论__用很多证据来证明  
2. **It is not long before** they are **so accustomed to** swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool
    **句型 1： It is not long before ... 没过多久， 就 ...**  
        过去时： It was not long before ... 当时， 没过多久， 就....  
        将来时： It will not be long before .... 用不了多久， 就....  
        复习 57 课： before 的思维请区别：  
            It is not long before A  
            It will be a long time before A  
    **句型 2： 习惯于做...**  
        be accustomed to doing = be used to doing （注意： 这里的 to 是介词）  
        Micheal is accustomed to getting up early in the morning.= Micheal is used to getting up early in the morning.  
        Nancy has been accustomed to being alone.= Nancy has been used to being alone.  
        如果强调习惯的过程, 把 be 动词换成表变化的动词： become/get  
        Nancy quickly got accustomed to being alone.= Nancy quickly got used to being alone.
3. 宾语的“大漂移”
    Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell.  
    相当于： Only time will tell whether they will ever become future Olympic champions.  
    为啥要把宾语前置？ 为了突出强调宾语要表达的内容和信息  
    例子 1： Exactly when the first people arrived in what we now know as California, no one really knows.  
    古汉语中也很多宾语前置：  
        比如： 唯命是听（命是听的宾语）， 唯利是图（利是图的宾语）。

At a swimming pool in Los Angeles, children who are taught to hold their breath under water before they can walk often begin learning to swim when two months old. Though they can pick up weights from the bottom of the pool, the game they enjoy most is the underwater tricycle race. This takes place seven feet under water and, while some children pedal their tricycles, others push of pull them. A few get across without coming up for air.  

## Composition

When the underwater tricycle race began, the children dived into the water. Afer they found their tricycles which were lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water, they started off. They competed against each other ot reach the other end of the pool. Most chilren pedal their tricycles, but some of them pushed or dragged them.

Towards the end of the race, a child who came first was pulling his tricycle, but he was so exhausted that he dropped it at last.
THe drooped tricycle, however, hindered two others just behind him. The two children struggled to get the tricycle out of the way. Just then, another child was pedaling hard and surpassed them. But as he was about to reach the other end and won the race, another child rose to the surface dragging up his tricycle. It was really an exciting and funny face.
