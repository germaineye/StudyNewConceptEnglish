# Lesson 50 Taken for a ride

我喜欢在乡间旅行, 但却不愿意迷路. 最近我作了一次短途旅行, 但这次旅行所花费的时间比我预计
的要长.
“我要去伍德福德草地, “我一上车就对售票员说, “但我不知道它在哪儿. “
“我来告诉您在哪儿下车, “售票员回答说.
我坐在汽车的前部, 以便饱览农村风光. 过了一些时候, 车停了. 我环视了一下身旁, 惊奇地发现车里
就只剩我一个乘客了.
“您得在这里下车, “售票员说, “我们的车就到此为止了. “
“这里是伍德福德草地吗？” 我问道.
“哎呀, “售票员突然说, “我忘了让您下车了. “
“没关系, “我说, “我就在这儿下吧. “
“我们现在要返回去, “售票员说.
“好吧, 既然如此, 我还是留在车上吧. “我回答说

I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.
I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.
'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I sais to conductor as I got on the bus,'but I don't know where it is.'
'I'll tell you where to get off,' answered the conductor.
I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.
After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.
'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we go'
'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.
'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'
'It doesn't matter,' I said, 'I'll get off here.
'We're going back now,' said the conductor.
'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus,' I answered.
