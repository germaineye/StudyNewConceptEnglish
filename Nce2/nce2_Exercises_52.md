# Lesson 52 A pretty carpet

我们刚刚搬进一所新房子, 我辛辛苦苦地干了整整一个上午. 我试图把我的新房间收拾整齐, 但这并
不容易, 因为我有 1,000 多本书. 更糟糕的是房间还非常小, 所以我暂时把书放在了地板上. 这会儿, 书把
地板的每一点空隙都占据了, 我实际上是踩着这些书进出房间的. 几分钟前, 我妹妹帮我把一个旧书橱抬
上了楼. 她走进我的房间, 当她看到地板上的那些书时, 大吃一惊. “这是我见过的最漂亮的地毯,” 她说.
她盯着 “地毯” 看了一会儿, 又说 : “你根本用不着书橱, 空闲时你可以坐在这儿读地毯!”

We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning.
I have been tring to get my new room in order.
This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books.
To make matters worse, the room is rather small, so I have temporarily put my books on the floor.
At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room. A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs.
She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor.
'This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen,' she said.
She gazed at it for some time then added, ' You don't need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the cartpet!'
