What was the danger to the villages after the fire?
Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could git it under control.
A short time before, great trees had covered the countryside for miles around.
Now, smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills.
Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well.
When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly.
The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes.
The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.
By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root.
In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries, patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.

## Summary writing

It took the firemen nearly three weeks to get the forest fire under control. 
Now that all the great trees had been burnt, there was danger that heavy rain would cause serious floods which would destroy the surrounding villages.
To prevent this, the forest authorities ordered grass-seed which it was sprayed over the ground by planes for nearly a month.
By the time that it begun to rain, in many places the grass had already taken root.

## Composition

The firemen cut down trees in order to they prevented the fire from spreading.
The fire which raged for two weeks, caused millions of pouds' worth of damage.
Forest workers planted young trees quickly so that the whole area would not become a desert.
