Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him. Three months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his wallet outside front door. It had been wrapped up in newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost, together with a note which said :' a thief, yes, but only 50 per cent a thief!'
