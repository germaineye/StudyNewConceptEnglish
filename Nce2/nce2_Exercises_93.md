Where was the Statue of Liberty made?
One of the most famous monuments in the world, the Statue of Liberty, was presented to the United States of America in the nineteenth century by the people of France. The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor Auguest Bartholdi,took ten years to complete. The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 188, the statue had been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.

    Now our ship is sailing into New York Harbour between Long Island and Staten Island. The first thing that catches my eye is the great monument of the Statue of Liberty, standing firmly at the entrance of N. Y. Harhour. It is 151 feet tall, and it looks so grand and charming that I am deeply impressed by it. As a symbol of liberty, the statue has attracted millions of people to New York, and to America as well.

    I have a first glimpse of New York City from Manhattan, which is one of the five boroughs of the city. There are many skyscrapers towering into the sky. The most strking ones are the Empire State Building and the United Nations Building. Great ships are busy sailing into or out of the harbour. Besides, there are long bridges with a lot of cars, buses and trucks, and many people are walking on the pavements.
