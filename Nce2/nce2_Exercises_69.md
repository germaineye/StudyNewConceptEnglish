你认为作者通过了驾驶考试吗？为什么？

我第 3 次接受驾驶执照考试。按照要求在车辆拥挤的路上驾驶，我圆满地完成了。在接到把车开出城
的指令后，我开始有了信心。确信我已通过考试，所以我几乎开始喜欢起这次考试。主考人对我的驾驶想
必是满意的，因为他微笑着说：“埃姆斯先生，只剩 1 项了。让我们假设一个小孩子突然在你前面穿过马
路。我一敲车窗，你必须把车停在 5 英尺之内。”我继续往前开着。过了一会儿，主考人砰砰地敲了起来。
虽然声音听得很清楚，但我过了好一会儿才作出反应。我突然用力踩紧刹车踏板，结果我俩的身体都向前
冲去。主考人伤心地看着我。“埃姆斯先生，”他以悲伤的声调说，“你刚刚把那个小孩压死了！

Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?

I was being tested for a driving license for the third time.
I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.
After having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence.
Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.
The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he smiled and said:'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames.
Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you. 
As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.'
I continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.
Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react.
I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.
The examiner looked at me sadly,'Mr. Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice,'you have just killed that child!'
