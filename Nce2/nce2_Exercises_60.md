# Lesson 60 The future

## Text

在一个乡村集市上，我决定去拜访一位称作别林斯夫人的算命人。我走进她的帐篷，她叫我坐下。我
给了她一些钱后，她便查看着一个水晶球说道：“您的一个亲戚就要来看您了。她将于今天傍晚到达，并
准备住上几天。您一走出这个帐篷，就会大吃一惊。一位您很熟悉的女人将向您冲来。她会对您说点什么，
然后带您离开这个地方。就是这些。”
我一走出帐篷，就把别林斯基夫人给算卦的事忘得一干二净了，因为我的妻子正匆匆向我跑来。“你躲
到哪儿去了？”她不耐烦地问，“再有不到一个小时你姐姐就要到这儿了，我们得去车站接她。现在就已
经晚了。”当她走开时，我也跟着她出了集市。

At a village fair, I decided to visit a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky.
I went into her tent and she told me to sit down.
After I had given her some money, she looked into a crystal and said:
'A relation of yours is coming to see you.
She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days.
The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise.
A woman you know well will rush towards you.
She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place. That is all.'
As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me.
'Where have you been hiding?' she asked impatiently.
'Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her.
We are late alreadly.'
As she waled away, I followed her out of the fair.
