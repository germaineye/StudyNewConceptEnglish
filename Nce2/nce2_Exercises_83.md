帕特里克为什么老是问同样的问题?

前首相温特沃兹.莱恩先生在最近的大选中被击败。他现在退出了政界，到国外去了。我的朋友帕特里
克一直是莱恩先生的激进党的强烈反对者。大选结束后，帕特里克来到了前首相的住处。当他询问莱恩先
生是否住在那里时，值班的警察告诉他这位前首相落选后出国去了。第二天，帕特里克再次来到首相的住
处。昨天的那位警察正从门口慢慢走过，帕特里克上前问了和昨天同样的问题。虽然那位警察这次有点疑
心，但还是对他作了同样的回答。第三天，帕特里克又去了，提出了同前两天完全一样的问题。这一次警
察火了。“我昨天和前天都告诉过您了，”他大叫着，“莱恩先生在大选中被击败了，他已经退出了政界去
国外了！”
“这我都知道，”帕特里克说，“可我就是喜欢听你说出这些！

Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question?

The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections.
He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad.
My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponet of Mr. Lane's Radical Progressive Party.
After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house.
When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there, the policman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.
On the following day, Patrick went to the house again.
The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question.
Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.
The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.
This time, the policeman lost his temper.
'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday,'Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections.
He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!'
'I know,' answered Patrick,'but I love to hear you say it!'

## Composition

    The politician was giving a pre-election speech, in order to win the election.
But he was so self-confident and ambitious that he gave big promises: he would provide more houses for the workers, set up some new school for the poor children, and adopt better economic and foreign policies.
    Then the audience began to ask him questions.
He answered them one by one patiently at first.
But when the members of the audience asked him some rude questions, he lost his temper, and said that the audience did not deserve more houses, high wage, etc. and he walked off angrily. 
As a result, the politician was defeated in the election.
