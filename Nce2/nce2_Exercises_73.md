Did the boy go where he wanted to?

Children who play truant from school are unimaginative.
A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get.
They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles.
He hitchhiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.
When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the meantime, travelled to Calais.
No none noticed the boy as he crept off.
From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry.
The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.
The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border.
There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.
He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading shcool.

## Composition

    The boy who went across the border of his country while playing truant finally returned home.
As he did not have enough food to eat for two days, he got sick, cold and hungry.
His parents were worried about his safety while he was away, and they looked for him everywhere.
When they unexpectedly met him at the harbour, they got so excited and happy that they could hardly believe their eyes.
His parents' reactions made the boy feel ashamed of himeself.
    When the boy returned to school after playing truant for several days, he was afraid he would be punished by the headmaster.
But all the boys gave him a hero's welcome, and asked him questions about his adventures.
And to his surprise, the headmaster punished him by making him give a talk to the whole school about his experience abroad.

## Letter writing

    You will never guess what happened the other day. I bought a new car with all my savings.
