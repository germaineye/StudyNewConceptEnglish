佩奇先生教书多久了？

我刚刚收到母校的一封信，通知我说以前的校长斯图亚特.佩奇先生下星期就退休了。为了纪念这个日
子，学校的学生——无论老同学还是新同学——将送他一件礼物。所有凑钱买此礼品的人都将自己的名字
签在一本大签名簿上，签名簿将被送到校长的家里。我们不会忘记佩奇先生对我们既有耐心又充满理解，
也不会忘记在我们不愿去上学时他给予我们的亲切鼓励。很多老同学都准备参加下星期四为他举行的告别
宴会。佩奇先生退休的前一天正好是他执教满 40 年的日子，这真是奇妙的巧合。他退休后，将致力于园

How long has Mr. Page been teaching?

I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week.
Pupils of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion.
All those who have contributed towards the gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's home.
We shall all remember Mr. Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went to unwillingly to school.
A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday.
It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr. Page will have been teaching for at total of forty years.
After he has retired, he will devote himself to gardening.
For him, this will be an entirely new hobby.
But this does not matter, for , as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.

1. **I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week.**  
定语从句都可以“瘦身” 为分词后置定语么？  
1） 分词后置定语: 注意， 这里的 informing me that... 是分词后置定语修饰 letter， 相当于 which informs me that ... . 我们之前学过： 分词后置定语相当于定语从句的简化。  
**简化需要两个条件： 1. 关系代词在定语从句中充当主语 2. 简化后不能有歧义**
2. **Pupils of the school, *old and new*, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion** 做后置定语的并列形容词：  
    1） pupil 这个词主要用在英式英语中表示学生， 尤指小学生， 现在有点过时， 现在更多人用 student。  
        这里的形容词 old and new 作为非限制性的后置定语， 但具有状语的意味， 相当于一个让步状语 whether they are old or new。  
    场景造句：  
        Steven has read a wide variety of books , ancient and modern , Chinese and foreign

    **你见过“套娃” 式的从句么？**  
        the kindly encouragement he gave us / when we went so unwillingly to school. 注意， 在定语从句中有一个“内部的状语从句  
    造句：  
    I would like to thank you for the unyielding support / （第一层） you gave me /（第二层） when I was facing the biggest difficulty /(第三层)I had ever had in my life.  
4. **One is never too old to learn.** 为啥表示“活到老， 学到老” ？

        The kids are too young to understand Shakespeare’s plays.= The kids are so young that they can’t understand Shakespeare’s plays.

## Composition

    My former headmaster was retired last month.　Pupils of the school, old and new, all attended the farewell party in his honour. At the party, he gave a speech in which he thanked all the pupils. He remembered his pupils' past and talked about their present. Many of them, now grown-ups, were successful in their careers. He especially enjoyed recalling some humorous incidents he had experienced with his puils.
     He also thought of his own future.  He would always cherish the memories of his good old days with pupils. He said old were welcome to come and visit him. After he retired, he would devote himself to gardening. For him, this would be an entirely new hobby. Perhaps it would take him forty years to put his garden in order, but it would not matter, as he had often said: 'One is never too old to learn.'
