Lesson 51 Predicting the future
第51课 预测未来

　　What was the 'future' electronic development that Leon Bagrit wasn't able to foresee?
    莱昴.巴格瑞特没有预测到的未来电子发展是什么？

　　Predicting the future is notoriously difficult.
    众所周知，预测未来是很难的
Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for example, that by the end of the 20th century, computers would be as common in people's homes as TV sets? 
例如，在1970代中谁能想像，到20世纪末电脑在人们家里就和电视一样普通
In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments, and large organizations. 
在70年代，电脑已经普及了，但只在在大公司，政府部门以及大型机构中
These were the so-called mainframe machines. 
他们被称为大型机
Mainframe computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air-conditioned rooms, employing full-time technicians and run on specially-written software. 
大型机确实是非常大的，经常有整个空调房那么大，要有全职技术人员运行专门写的软件
Though these large machines still exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful personal computers, commonly known as PCs.
尽管那些大型机仍然存在，但是他们很多功能已经被小而强大的个人电脑代替，俗称PC

　　In 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA. 
    在1975年，一台被称做“牛郎星”的最原始机器被推出
It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future. 
严格地说起来，它可以被称为第一台“家用电脑”，而且它指明了今后的发展方向
This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. 
接下来，在70年代末，是一台被称为苹果的机器
In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM produced the world's first Personal Computer. 
在80年代早期，电脑巨人IBM生产了世界上第一台个人电脑
This ran on an 'operating system' called DOS, produced by a then small company named Microsoft. 
这个面运行着一个操作系统叫DOS，是那时一家名叫微软的小公司生产的
The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied. 
IBM个人电脑被广泛仿制
From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today.
从那些简陋的开端，我们已经看到人性化的家用电脑多媒体机器的发展，它们被广泛使用的今天
　　Considering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today. 
考虑那些最近发展如何的是一位英国人，莱昴.巴格瑞特，这比60年代之前更引人注目，他能预测我们今天所知的电脑的一些应用
Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days. 
巴格瑞特排除了电脑将学会自己思考将统治世界，在那时，人们相相信会如此
Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work. 
巴格瑞特预料到一个时期，将来电脑很小可以拿在手上，将来他们可以提供堵车信息并建议可以选择的路径，将来他们可以被使用在医院帮助医生检测疾病，将来他们可以减轻办公室人员和枯燥的会计人员重复乏味的文书工作
All these computer uses have become commonplace. 
所有这些电脑的使用已经变的很平常
Of course, Leon Bagrit could not possibly have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks. 
当然，莱昴.巴格瑞特即不可能预见到互联网的发展，这个全球系统使我们能够即时和在世界上任何地方的人通过电脑联接电话网络沟通
Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known subject, so we can read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to. 
也不能预料到我们如何使用网络在每个已知的主题上获取信息，因此我们能在家里的屏幕上能够看到信息，如果我们想的话甚至可以打印它
Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper. 
电脑变得越来越小，越来越强大也越来越便宜
This is what makes Leon Bagrit's predictions particularly remarkable. 
这就是为什么莱昴.巴格瑞特的预测成为举世瞩目
If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years.
如果他或像他一样的人活到今天，他或许能告诉我们在下一个50年我们能将期待什么


第51课 预测未来
Lesson 51 Predicting the future

    众所周知，预测未来是非常困难的
    Predicting the future is notoriously difficult.
举个例子吧，在20世纪70年代中叶又有谁能想得到在20世纪末的时候，家庭用的计算机会像电视机一样普遍?
Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for example, that by the end of the 20th century, computers would be as common in people's homes as TV sets.
在70年代，计算机已经相当普及了，但只用在大公司，政府部门和大的组织之中，
In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments and large orgnizations.
它们被称为主机
These were the so-called mainframe machines
计算机主机确实很大，常常占据了装有空调的多间房间，雇用专职的技师，而且得用专门编写的软件才能运行
Mainframe computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air-conditioned rooms, employing full-time technicians and run on specially-written software.
虽然这种大计算机仍然存在，但它们的许多功能已被体积小但功能齐全的个人电脑——即我们常说的PC机——所代替了。
Though these large machines still exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful personal computers, commonly known as PCs.
　　1975年，美国推出了一台被称为“牛郎星”的原始机型
    In 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA.
严格地说起来，它可以被称为第一台“家用电脑”，而且它也指了今后的方向
It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future.
70年代末，在牛郎星之后又出现了一种被称为“苹果”的机型
This was followed, at the end of 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. 
80年代初，计算机行业的王牌公司美国国际商用机器公司(IBM)生产出了世界上第一台个人电脑
In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM produced the world's first Personal Computer.
这种电脑采用了一种被称为磁盘操作系统(DOS)的工作程序，而这种程序是由当时规模不大的微软公司生产的
This ran on an 'operating system' called DOS, produced by a then small company named Microsoft.
IBM的个人电脑被大规模地模仿
The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied.
从那些简陋的初级阶段，我们看到了现在都已普及的、使用简便的家用电脑和多媒体的微机的发展
From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and mutimedia machines which are in common use today.
　　想一想这些发展的时间多么短，就更觉得英国人莱昂.巴格瑞特有着非凡的能力,他在60年代就能预言我们今天知道的计算机的一些用途
    Considering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today.
巴格瑞特根本不接受计算机可以学会自己去“思考”和计算可以“统治世界”这种想法，而这种想法是当时的人们都愿意相信的
Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days.
巴格瑞特预示有一天计算机可以小到拿在手上，计算机可以提供有关交通阻塞的信息，并建议可供选择的其它路线，计算机在医院里可以帮助医生诊断病情，计算机可以使办公室人员和会计免除那些枯燥、重复的劳动
Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work.
计算机的所有这些功能现在都变得很平常
All these computer uses have become commonplace.
当然了，莱昂.巴格瑞特根本没有可能预测到国际交互网——就是把计算机连结到电话线路上，以便和世界上任何一个地方的人立即进行联系的一个世界范围的通讯系统——的发展
Of course, Leon Bagrit could not possibly have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks.
他也无法预测到我们可以利用国际交互网获取有关任何已知专题的信息，以便在家里的屏幕上阅读，如果愿意的话甚至可以将其打印出来
Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known suject, so we read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to.
计算机已经变得体积越来越小，功能越来越多，价格越来越低，
Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper.
这就是莱昂.巴格瑞特的预测非凡的地方
This is what makes Leon Bagrit's predictions particularly remarkable.
如果他或是像他的什么人今天还活着的话，他大概可以告诉我们下一个50年后会发生什么事情
If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years.

Lesson 52 Mud is mud

　　实事求是

　　Why did Harry decide to give up his little game?
    为什么哈里决定放弃他的小游戏？

　　My cousin, Harry, keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study. 
    我的表兄，哈里，在他的书房永久陈列着一个很大形状奇怪的瓶子
Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, grayish substance. 
尽管瓶子被染成淡绿色，一个观察敏锐的客人很快注意到，它里面像充满了一个粘稠的浅灰色的东西
If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. 
如果你问哈里瓶子里面是什么？他将会告诉你里面装着香水泥
If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. 
如果你表示怀疑或是惊讶，他立刻请你闻一下然后涂抹一些在你皮肤上
This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have. 
这个简短的实验将驱散你可能有的更多的怀疑
The bottle really does contain perfumed mud. 
这个瓶子确实装的香水泥
How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating. 
哈里如何得到这个稀奇古怪的东西有一个他很喜欢讲的有趣的故事
Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.
而且，这个瓶子的获得治好了他很多年的一个坏习惯
　　Harry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. 
哈里曾经认进入一家奢侈的化妆品店，无理的要求一个不存在的商品是一件很开心的事
He would invent fanciful names on the spot. 
他当场发明了一个想像的名字
On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'. 
一走进店里，他就要一款名为：香味魅影的新香水，或是不溶浴皂
If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. 
如果店员告诉他没有听过，他就装做非常的不高兴
He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did. 
他喜欢被告之他想像中的产品之一暂时脱销，他就煞有介事地许诺改天再来光顾，当然他再也不会来了
How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.
哈里是如何在这些表演时成功保持一本正经的样子让我无法想象
　　Harry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud.
    并不需要追问哈里是如何买到这个珍贵的泥瓶子的
One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite', the shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable.
一天，他去了伦敦一家高档商品专卖店，想要‘Myrlite', 店员看起来很迷惑，哈里加重了每个一音节缓慢的重复了一遍这个词
When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. 
当店员迷惑的摇了摇头的时候，哈里继续解释道，‘myrolite'是一个硬的，像琥珀一样的东西，它能被用来消除雀斑
This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. 
这个解释明显传达了一些东西给店员，她找了一排排货架
She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements. 
她制造了各种古怪的调制品，但是没有一样符合哈里的需求
When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him. 
当哈里上演了他稍微恼怒的举动时，店员许诺为他订购一些
Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. 
被自己的成功陶醉后，哈里要了香水泥
He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment. 
他期待店员茫然惊奇的看着他
However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. 
然而，轮到他惊讶了，因为店面的眼睛马上亮了，她取来几个瓶子放在柜台上给哈里看
For once, Harry had to admit defeat. 
仅此一次，哈里不得不承认被打败了
He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. 
他拿起一个看起来最小的瓶子小心的问价格
He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. 
他仅仅用了20英镑高兴的离开了，他敲着这胳膊下面捂着的珍贵瓶子匆忙离开
他很庆幸只破费了20英镑，他把那宝贵的瓶子夹在腋下，溜之大吉
From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. 
从那以后，哈里确定他发明的这个小游戏可能显示是昂贵的
The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study, was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.
现在他书房里装饰着书柜的奇怪的瓶子是他第一次也是最后一次买的稀有的化妆品

Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, greyish substance.
要是你问哈里瓶里装着什么，他会告诉你是香水泥
If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud.
如果你表示怀疑或惊奇，他会立即请你闻一闻，然后取出一些抹在你的皮肤上

Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.
　　哈里曾认为走进一家名贵化妆品商店，荒唐地提出要买一种根本不存在的商品是件开心的事儿
    Harry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist.
他会当场编造出一些稀奇古怪的货名
He would invent fanciful names on the spot.
他走进商店后，会提出要一种名叫“香影”的新型香水或什么“不溶浴皂”
On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'.
要是女售货员告诉他从未听说过这些东西，他会装出十分遗憾和不安的样子
If a shop assistant told him she had heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out.
他爱听售货员说他想像出来的那种东西暂时脱销，于是他就煞有介事地许诺改天再来光顾,当然，他再也不会来了
He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did.
我实在想像不出哈里在这些表演中是怎样装出一本正经的样子的。
How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.
　　毋须暗示哈里就会向你讲起他买下那瓶珍贵香水泥的经过
    Harry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud.
一天，他去伦敦一家高级商店要买一种叫“密诺莱特”的东西，
One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite'.
店员露出诧异的神色,哈里又慢慢地，一字一顿说了一遍这个词，
The shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable.
那个女售货员还是迷惑不解地摇了摇头, 哈里便进一步解释“密诺莱特”是一种质地坚硬、状似琥珀的东西，可以用来除去雀斑
When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles.
他的解释显然对女售货员有些启示,她一个货架接着一个货架地寻找，
This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf.
拿出各种各样稀奇古怪的化妆品，但没有一样能够符合哈里的要求
She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements.
哈里装出不高兴的样子时，女售货员答应为他定货
When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him.
哈里为他的骗术而感到洋洋得意，又提出要买香水泥
Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud.
他原想女售货员会惊奇地望着他，不知所措，
He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment.
没料到这回该轮到他自己吃惊了。因为那女售货员听完哈里的话后，马上眼睛一亮，拿出几瓶东西放在柜台上让哈里挑选。
However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman's eyes immediately lit up and she fecthed several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect.
哈里只好认输。
For once, Harry had to admit defeat.
他挑出一个看上去最小的瓶子，谨慎地问了价
He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price.
他庆幸自己只破费了20英镑便得以脱身。他把那宝贵的瓶子放在腋下夹着，溜之大吉
He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm.
从那以后，他认识到自己发明的小小恶作剧是要付出很大的代价的
From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive.
在他书房的书柜里摆着那瓶形状古怪的香水泥就是他第一次也是最后一次购买的稀有化妆品。
The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study, was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.

Lesson 52 Mud is mud

    我的堂兄哈里在他的书房里一直摆着一只形状古怪的大瓶子
    My cousin, Harry, keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study.
尽管那只瓶子呈淡绿色，但细心的客人很快就会发现瓶里装的是一种看上去黏稠，颜色发灰的东西
Despite the fact that the bottle is tined a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, greyish substance.
要是你问哈里瓶里装着什么，他会告诉你是香水泥
If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it cantained perfumed mud.
如果你表示怀疑或惊奇，他会立即请你闻一闻，然后取出一些抹在你的皮肤上
If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin.
这一简单的试验会消除你可能存有的一切疑虑
This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have.
瓶里装的的确是香水泥

The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint.
他可以善意地批评某位官员，也可以甚至向议会提议修改某项法律
He may gently reprimand an official or even sugguest to parliament that a law be altered.
下述事件是司法特派员工作的一个典型例子
The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman's work.
　　一个住在瑞典乡村的外国人写信给司法特派员，抱怨说他受到警察的虐待，原因就是因为他是个外国人
    A foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police, simply because he was a foreigner.
司法特派员立即写信给当地警察局长，请他寄送与此事有关的材料
The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case.
材料中没有任何文字记载证明外国人所说的情况符合事实，警察局长矢口否认这一指控
There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner's complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation.
司法特派员难以处理。但是，当他又收到住在同一村庄的另一个外国人写的一封内容类似的投诉信时，他立即派出一位律师前去调查
It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he immediately sent one of his lawyers to investigate the matter.
律师证实有个警察确实多次粗鲁地对待外国人
The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions.
警察歧视外国人的事在官方档案中不可能加以记载，
The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files.
司法特派员只有派他的代表去核对事实才能了解真相
It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts.
当事的警察受到严厉的斥责，并被告知，如果再有人投诉他，他将受到起诉
The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him, he would be prosecuted.
司法特派员及时采取的行动，迅速制止了这一起不愉快的事件，不然这件事可能因未得到人们注意而不了了之
The Ombdudsman's prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.

Lesson 54 Instinct or cleverness?

第54课 是本能还是机智

　　Was the writer successful in protecting his peach tree? Why not?
    作者有成功保护他的桃树吗？为什么？
　　We have been brought up to fear insects. 
    我们从小就害怕虫子
We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. 
我们把他们看作弊多利少不必要的生物
We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. 
我们持续和他们作战，因为他们污染我们食物，传染疾病，吞噬庄稼
They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat against our lighted windows. 
他们无缘无故叮咬人；他们在夏天的晚上不请自来飞入我们的房间，反复拍打我们亮灯的窗户
We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless one like moths. 
我们生活中厌恶不但有像蜘蛛或大黄蜂之类的有害昆虫，也有像飞蛾无害的昆虫
Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. 
阅读他们的书籍增长认识也没有消除我们的恐惧
Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. 
当看一群蚂蚁爬上一个精心准备的野餐时，明知勤劳的蚂蚁生活在一个高度有组织的社会里也无法阻止我们的厌恶
No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. 
无论我们有多喜欢蜂蜜，或我们读了多少蜜蜂有神密的方向感，我们还是害怕被蜇
Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. 
我们的害怕大多是不合理的，但是他们不可能被消除
At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. 
然而，与此同时，昆虫也是极具吸引力
We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. 
我们很喜欢看关于它们的书，特别当我们发现像螳螂，他们过着令人生畏的生活
We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence.
我们喜欢盯着他们看，着迷的就像是从事他们的生意，我们无意（我们希望）表出来的
我喜欢入迷的看它们做事，它们不知道（但愿如此）我们就在它们身边
Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle?
当看到一只蜘蛛猛扑向一只飞虫或是一队蚂蚁耀武扬威把一只巨型死甲虫扛回家时谁不肃然起敬？
　　Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. 
去年夏天我花了几天时候在花园观察几千只蚂蚁爬上我心爱的桃树干
The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. 
这棵桃树已成长在一面温暖的墙对面在房子的无危险的一边
那棵树靠着房子有遮挡的一面向阳的墙生长
I am especially proud of it, not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. 
我是特别为它感到自豪，不仅因为它经历几个严冬而幸存，而且因为它有时结出美味的桃子来
During the summer, I noticed that the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. 
在这个夏天，我看到桃树叶子正在开始枯萎
Clusters of tiny insects called aphids were to be found on the underside of the leaves. 
叫做蚜虫的成群的小虫子被发现在叶子的背面
They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. 
他们正被一大群蚂蚁光顾，蚂蚁从他们那里获取一种蜜
I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though it failed to get rid of the ants, kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. 
我立即着手了一个实验，即使无法摆脱这些蚂蚁，也让我着迷了24小时
I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids. 
我用胶带把树的底部绑住，让蚂蚁无法到达蚜虫
The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it. 
胶带是如些的粘，以至于他们不敢穿过它
For a long time，I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. 
很长一段时间，我看他们围绕着树的底部乱窜陷入了困惑中
I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. 
我甚至在半夜用手电走出去，满意的看着，这些蚂蚁仍然成群地围绕胶带毫无办法
I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. 
我第二天一早起来希望这些蚂蚁已在绝望中放弃
Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route. 
反而，我看到他们已经找到一条新的路
They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. 
他们正爬上房子的上，然后爬往树叶去
I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. 
我悲哀的意识到我已经完全被他们的机智打败
The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!
蚂蚁已经很快找到对策，来对付我那套完全不科学方法

我用一条胶带把桃树底部包上，不让蚂蚁接近蚜虫
I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids.
胶带极粘，蚂蚁不敢从上面爬过
The tape was so sticky that they did not dare to cross it.
在很长一段时间里，我看见蚂蚁围着大树底部来回转悠，不知所措
For a long time, I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment.
半夜，我还拿着电筒来到花园里，满意地(同时惊奇地)发现那些蚂蚁还围着胶带团团转。无能为力
I even went out with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it.
第二天早上，我起床后希望看见蚂蚁已因无望而放弃了尝试，
I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair.
结果却发现它们又找到一条新的路径
Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route.
它们正在顺着房子的外墙往上爬，然后爬上树叶
They were clambing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree.
我懊丧地感到败在了足智多谋的蚂蚁的手下
I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity.
蚂蚁已很快找到了相应的对策，来对付我那套完全不科学的办法!
The ants had been quicky to find an anwser to my thoroughly unscientific methods!

第54课 是本能还是机智

   我们自幼就在对昆虫的惧怕中长大

我们把昆虫当作害多益少的无用东西

人类不断同昆虫斗争，因为昆虫弄脏我们的食物，传播疾病，吞噬庄稼。

它们无缘无故地又叮又咬;夏天的晚上，它们未经邀请便飞到我们房间里，或者对着露出亮光的窗户乱扑乱撞

我们在日常生活中，不但憎恶如蜘蛛、黄蜂之类令人讨厌的昆虫，而且憎恶并无大害的飞蛾等

阅读有关昆虫的书能增加我们对它们的了解，却不能消除我们的恐惧的心理

即使知道勤奋的蚂蚁生活具有高度组织性的社会里，当看到大群蚂蚁在我们精心准备的午间野餐上爬行时，我们也无法抑制对它们的反感

不管我们多么爱吃蜂蜜，或读过多少关于蜜蜂具有神秘的识别方向的灵感的书，我们仍然十分害怕被蜂蜇

我们的恐惧大部分是没有道理的，但却无法消除

同时，不知为什么昆虫又是迷人的

我们喜欢看有关昆虫的书，尤其是当我们了解螳螂等过着一种令人生畏的生活时，就更加爱读有关昆虫的书了

我们喜欢入迷地看它们做事，它们不知道(但愿如此)我们就在它们身边

当看到蜘蛛扑向一只苍蝇时，一队蚂蚁抬着一只巨大的死甲虫凯旋归时，谁能不感到敬畏呢?

　　去年夏天，我花了好几天时间站在花园里观察成千只蚂蚁爬上我那棵心爱的桃树的树干

那棵树是靠着房子有遮挡的一面暖墙生长的

我为这棵树感到特别自豪，不仅因为它度过了几个寒冬终于活了下来，而且还因为它有时结出些甘甜的桃子来

到了夏天，我发现树叶开始枯萎，

结果在树叶背面找到成串的叫作蚜虫小虫子

蚜虫遭到一窝蚂蚁的攻击，蚂蚁从它们身上可以获得一种蜜

我当即动手作了一项试验，这项试验尽管没有使我摆脱这些蚂蚁，却使我着迷了24小时。

我用一条胶带把桃树底部包上，不让蚂蚁接近蚜虫

胶带极粘，蚂蚁不敢从上面爬过

在很长一段时间里，我看见蚂蚁围着大树底部来回转悠，不知所措

半夜，我还拿着电筒来到花园里，满意地(同时惊奇地)发现那些蚂蚁还围着胶带团团转。无能为力

第二天早上，我起床后希望看见蚂蚁已因无望而放弃了尝试，

结果却发现它们又找到一条新的路径

它们正在顺着房子的外墙往上爬，然后爬上树叶

我懊丧地感到败在了足智多谋的蚂蚁的手下

蚂蚁已很快找到了相应的对策，来对付我那套完全不科学的办法!

Lesson 55 From the earth: Greetings
　　来自地球的问候
　　Listen to the tape then answer the question below.
　　听录音，然后回答以下问题。
　　Which life forms are most likely to develop on a distant planet?
    哪一种生命形式最有可能在遥远的星球上发展？
　　Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies. 
    最近天文学的发展已经使探测银河系和其它星系成为可能
This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and old not emit light. 
这是一个重大的成就，因为相对来说那些星球又小又古老不能发光
Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. 
发现星球非常的难，但是要在上面找到生命更是极其困难
The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. 
首先要回答的一个问题是否一个星球能确实适合生命
In our won solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. 
在我们太阳里，例如，金星太热，火星又太冷，生命无法生存
Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.
只有地球提供了理想的条件，即使在这里它也花了超过40亿年时间才发展出植物和动物的生命
　　Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. 
    一个星球是否能有生命依赖于它的恒星的尺寸和亮度，这个恒星是就它的太阳
Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. 
想像一颗恒星直到比我们太阳大，亮，热20倍
A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. 
一星球要有支持生命的能力必定要走很长的路
Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. 
或者，如果恒星很小，支持生命的星球必须要有一个更靠近它的轨道，也可以为生命发展提供完美的条件
But how would we find such a planet? 
但是我们将如何找到一个这样的星球呢？
At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. 
目前，没有现存的望远能够探测生命的存存
The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.
研制这样一个望远镜将是二十一世纪最大的天文学项目之一

　　It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. 
    使用放置在地球上的望远镜在另一个星球上寻找生命是不可能的
Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. 
我们温暖的大气层和热能导致望远镜将不可能探测到很小的星球
Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system. 
即使一个在绕地球轨道的望远镜，像非常成功的哈勃望远镜，也是不适合的，因为有太阳粒子
A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. 
为了寻找外太空生命望远镜将必须放在像木星一样远的星球，因为尘埃变的非常在先远的地方，我们旅行到太阳系边缘的外部
Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. 
一旦我们探测到一颗这样的星球，我们必须找到一种方法遮挡它的恒星的光芒，以便我们更彻底观察这个星球和分析它的大气层
In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. 
首先，我们将寻找植物，而不是小绿人
The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. 
一个星球最有可能发展出的生命形势将会是细菌
It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. 
细菌生产我们在地球上呼吸的氧气
For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. 
因为它们在地球的大多数历史中是唯一存在的生命形式
As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. 
作为地球居民，我们总是报有希望，小绿人光临我们，能够和他们沟通
But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. 
但是这个愿望总是存在于科幻小说中
If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. 
如果我们能够在另外一个星球上发现像细菌样的低等生命，那么这将彻底改变我们的观点
As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. 
正如NASA的丹尼尔.戈尔丁指出，在别的地方发现生命将改变一切
No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it."
任何人类的努力或是想法都将被它们改变

第55课 来自地球的问候
Lesson 55 From the earth: greetings
　　
天文学方面最新发展使得我们能够在银河系和其他星系发现行星
Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies.
这是一个重要的成就，因为相对来说，行星很小，而且也不发光
This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and do not emit light.
寻找行星证明相当困难，但是要在行星上发现生命会变得无比艰难
Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult.
第一个需要解答的问题是一颗行星是否有能够维持生命的条件
The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life?
举例来说，在我们的太阳系里，对于生命来说，金星的温度太高，而火星的温度则太低
In our own solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life.
只有地球提供理想的条件，而即使在这里，植物和动物的进化也用了40亿年的时间
Only the earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evelve.
　　一颗行星是否能够维持生命取决于它的恒星——即它的“太阳”——的大小和亮度
    Whether a planet can support life to depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'.
设想一下，一颗恒星比我们的太阳还要大，还要亮，还要热20倍，
Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our sun.
那么一颗行星为了维持生命就要离开的它的恒星非常远
A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life.
反之，如果恒星很小，维持生命的行星就要在离恒星很近的轨道上运行，而且要有极好的条件才能使生命得以发展，
Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop.
但是，我们如何才能找到这样一颗行星呢?
But how would we find such a planet?
现在，没有一台现存的望远镜可以发现生命的存在
At present, there is no telescope in existing that is capable of detecting the presence of life.
而开发这样一台望远镜将会是21世纪天文学的一个重要的研究课题
The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.
　　使用放置在地球上的望远镜是无法观察到其他行星的生命的
    It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes.
地球周围温暖的大气层和望远镜散出的热量使得我们根本不可能找到比行星更小的物体
Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets.
即使是一台放置在围绕地球的轨道上的望远镜——如非常成功的哈勃望远镜——也因为太阳系中的尘埃微粒而无法胜任
Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system.
望远镜要放置在木星那样遥远的行星上才有可能在外层空间搜寻生命,因为我们越是接近太阳系的边缘，尘埃就越稀薄
A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system.
一旦我们找到这样一颗行星，我们就要想办法将它的恒星射过来的光线遮暗，这样我们就能彻底“看见”这颗行星，并分析它的大气层
Once we detected such a planet, we would have to find a way of bloting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere.
首先我们要寻找植物，而不是那种“小绿人”
In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'.
行星上最容易生存下来的是细菌
The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria.
正是细菌生产出我们在地球上呼吸的氧气
It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth
在地球上发展的大部分进程中，细菌是地球上唯一的生命形式
For most of the earth's history they have been only life form of life on our planet.
作为地球上的居民，我们总存有这样的希望：小绿人来拜访我们，而我们可以和他们交流
As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them.
但是，这种希望总是只在科幻小说中存在
But this hope is alway in the realms of science fiction
如果我们能够在另一颗行星上找到诸如细菌的那种低等生命，那么这个发现将彻底改变我们对我们自己的看法
If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves.
正如美国国家航空和宇宙航空局的丹尼尔.戈尔丁指出的 “在其他地方发现生命会改变一切,任何人类的努力和想法都会发生变化。”
As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, "Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavour or thought would be unchanged by it."
