Lesson 41 Illusions of Pastoral peace
第41课 宁静田园生活的遐想

The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. 
宁静的乡村生活对我完全没有吸引力
City born and city bred，I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasional visit during the weekend. 
我土生土长在城里，我看待农村就像你透过火车的窗户看到的东西一样，或者是你偶尔在周末去参观的东西
Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. 
我大部份朋友都住在城里，然而他只要一提到乡村就欣喜若狂
Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of them has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. 
尽管他们称赞宁静生活的优点，他们只有一位曾去乡村生活过并且不到6个月就返回了镇上
Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. 
即使他仍然生活在乡村生活是如何优越城镇生活的错觉下
He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living.
他总是说起友好的乡亲，清新的空气，和大自的亲密接触以及悠闲的生活
Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. 
他继续说到，没有事情能和第一声公鸡啼叫，黎明的鸟鸣，第一缕阳光在树梢和牧草上闪耀
This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.
这种田园诗歌的情景只是描绘的一部分
My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV -- virtually the only form of entertainment. 
我朋友没有提到漫长孤独的冬夜电视几乎是唯一的娱乐形式
He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. 
他没有说在商店里可选择的商品少的可怜，也没有说那些不幸的人们必须要每天从这个村子到城里去上班
Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. 
为什么人们准备忍受每天4个小时的路程为了在乡村可疑的优越生活是我无法理解的
They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.
他们能够不用遭受这么多的痛苦和代价，如果他们选择生活在城里合适的地方
If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. 
如果你没有那一点点乡村田园的快乐也行，你将发现城市能提供给你最好的生活
You never have to travel miles to see your friends. 
你永远不需要走几英里去看你的朋友们
They invariably lie nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. 
他们经常在你附近，经常能够在一起闲聊或是晚上娱乐活动
Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. 
我认识的一些在乡村的人每年一两次进城看戏就像是过节一样
For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning. 
因为他们这样是一个重大的行动牵涉到相当多的计划
As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. 
当戏接近尾声的时候，他们想知道是否他们到底赶不赶得上最后一趟火车回家
The cit dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. 
城市居民从来不用经历这种焦虑
The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. 
最新的展览、电影，戏剧只有一个短程巴士的距离
Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. 
购物也总是非常的愉快
There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. 
这里是很多品种，你永远不必面勉强选择第二好的
Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. 
当村民在城里购物蹒跚载着他们尽可能带的动的非常多的外来物品回家时他们一度失去控制
Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. 
并非是这个城市没有美丽的瞬间
There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. 
有一些令人欣慰是广告牌在冰冷冬天的雨夜发出温暖光芒
Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. 
很少有事情能够比这更让人印像深刻，当每天出行去工作的成千上万的人隐身在乡村的家中，宁静降落在周末空旷的大街
It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.
那些居住在城里，喜欢所有的这些事情，顽固假装他们宁可生活在乡村的人们总是让我无法理解

第41课 宁静田园生活的遐想
Lesson 41 Illusion of pastoral peace

宁静的乡村生活从来没有吸引过我
The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me.
我生在城市，长在城市，总认为乡村是透过火车车窗看到的那个样了，或偶尔周末去游玩一下景象
City born and city bred, I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasionally visit during the weekend.
我的许多朋友都住在城市，但他们只要一提起乡村，马上就会变得欣喜若狂
Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country.
尽管他们都交口称赞宁静的乡村生活的种种优点，但其中只有一个人真去农村住过，而且不足6个月就回来了
Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of them has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months.
即使他也仍存有幻觉，好像乡村生活就是比城市生活优越
Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life.
他滔滔不绝地大谈友好的农民，洁净的空气，贴近大自然的环境和悠闲的生活节奏
He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gently pace of living.
他坚持认为，凌晨雄鸡第一声啼叫，黎明时分小鸟吱喳欢叫，冉冉升起的朝阳
Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures.
但这种田园诗般的乡村风光仅仅是一个侧面
This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.
我的朋友没有提到在电视机前度过的漫长寂寞的冬夜——电视是唯一的娱乐形式
My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV --- virtually the only form of entertainment.
他也不说商店货物品种单调，以及那些每天不得不从乡下赶到城里工作的不幸的人们
He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travle from the country to the city every day to get to work.
人们为什么情愿每天在路上奔波4个小时去换取值得怀疑的乡间的优点，我是无法理解的
Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me.
要是他们愿意住在本来属于他们的城市，则可以让他们省去诸多不便与节约大量开支
They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.

如果你愿舍弃乡下生活那一点点乐趣的话，那么你会发出城市可以为你提供生活最美好的东西
If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer.
你去看朋友根本不用跋涉好几英里，
You never have to travel miles to see your friends.
因为他们都住在附近，你随时可以同他们聊天或在晚上一起娱乐
They invariably live nearby and are always availably for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment.
我在乡村有一些熟人，他们每年进城来看一回或几回戏，并把此看作一种特殊的享受
Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat.
看戏在他们是件大事，需要精心计划
For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning.
当戏快演完时，他们又为是否能赶上末班火车回家而犯愁
As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home.
这种焦虑，城里人是从未体验过的
The city dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort.
坐公共汽车几站路，就可看到最新的展览、电影、戏剧
The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away.
买东西也是一种乐趣
Shopping, too, is always a pleasure.
物品种繁多，从来不必用二等品来凑合
There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best.
乡里人进城采购欣喜若狂，每次回家时都买足了外来商品，直到拿不动方才罢休，连走路都摇摇晃晃的
Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry.
城市也并非没有良辰美景
Nor is the city without its moments of beauty.
寒冷潮湿的冬夜里，广告灯箱发出的暖光，会给人某种安慰
There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights.
周末，当成千上万进城上班的人回到他们的乡间寓所之后，空旷的街市笼罩着一种宁静气氛，没有什么能比此时的宁静更令人难忘了
Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country.
城里人对这一切心里很明白，却偏要执拗地装出他们喜欢住在乡村的样子，这对我来说一直是个谜
It has always been a mistery to me why city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.

Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures.
但这种田园诗般的乡村风光仅仅是一个侧面
This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.
我的朋友没有提到在电视机前度过的漫长寂寞的冬夜——电视是唯一的娱乐形式
My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV --- virtually the only form of entertainment.
他也不说商店货物品种单调，以及那些每天不得不从乡下赶到城里工作的不幸的人们
He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work.
人们为什么情愿每天在路上奔波4个小时去换取值得怀疑的乡间的优点，我是无法理解的
Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of the country is beyond me.
要是他们愿意住在本来属于他们的城市，则可以让他们省去诸多不便与节约大量开支
They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.

如果你愿舍弃乡下生活那一点点乐趣的话，那么你会发现城市可以为你提供生活最美好的东西
If you can do without the few pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer.
你去看朋友根本不用跋涉好几英里，
You never have to travel miles to see your friends.
因为他们都住在附近，你随时可以同他们聊天或在晚上一起娱乐
They invariably live nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's etertainment.
我在乡村有一些熟人，他们每年进城来看一回或几回戏，并把此看作一种特殊的享受
Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat.
看戏在他们是件大事，需要精心计划
For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning.
当戏快演完时，他们又为是否能赶上末班火车回家而犯愁
As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home.
这种焦虑，城里人是从未体验过的
The city dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort.
坐公共汽车几站路，就可看到最新的展览、电影、戏剧
The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away.
买东西也是一种乐趣
Shopping, too, is always a pleasure.
物品种繁多，从来不必用二等品来凑合
There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best.
乡里人进城采购欣喜若狂，每次回家时都买足了外来商品，直到拿不动方才罢休，连走路都摇摇晃晃的
Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry.
城市也并非没有良辰美景
Nor is the city without its moments of beauty.
寒冷潮湿的冬夜里，广告灯箱发出的暖光，会给人某种安慰
There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by adevrtisements on cold wet winter nights.
周末，当成千上万进城上班的人回到他们的乡间寓所之后，空旷的街市笼罩着一种宁静气氛，没有什么能比此时的宁静更令人难忘了
Few things could be more imprissive than the peace that descends on deserts city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country.
城里人对这一切心里很明白，却偏要执拗地装出他们喜欢住在乡村的样子，这对我来说一直是个谜
It has always been a mystery to me why city dweller, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.

第42课 现代洞穴人

Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. 
洞穴探索或洞穴探险正如它正逐渐为人所知那样，是一项相对新生运动
Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. 
或许渴望孤独或是为了创造一个意想不到的发现机会诱惑人们深入地球深处
It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. 
无法满意的给出洞穴探险者的动机
For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. 
就像高山对于攀登者一样，洞穴对于洞穴探险者有同样的独特魅力
They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.
他们唤醒朦胧的本能(他们激发(探险的)本能，只可意会不可言传)
Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. 
探索真正深的洞穴绝不是周日午后漫步
Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. 
这样的任务需要精心策划和军事运筹的深谋远虑（这种活动需要具备军事行动般的周密布署和预见能力）
It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. 
下降进入一个很深的岩洞之前光搭建绳梯和建立一些补给基地就要花八天的时间
(有时需要花费整整 8 天时间来搭绳梯，建立供应基地，然后才能下到一个很深的洞穴里)
Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. 
这种预防是必要的，因为不能可预测确切洞穴探险者将会面临的大自然困境
The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. 
世上已知最深的洞穴是格里诺布尔附近的高弗·伯杰洞
It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet. 
它延伸地底3,723英尺深
This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks. 
这个巨大的深坑是一条地下河流形成的，它已经洞穿了一条穿过岩石裂缝的通道
The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. 
这个洞穴的入口是在多芬·阿尔卑斯山高原
As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable. 
它只有6英尺宽，因此很难被发现
The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. 
若不是法国著名洞穴探险家伯杰无意中发现，这个洞穴也许永远也不会有人发现
Since its discovery, it has become a sort of potholers' Everest. 
自从它被发现以为，它已经变成洞穴探险者们的珠穆朗玛了
Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.
尽管已经多次下降，它大部份仍然未被探索
　　
A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger.

After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to narrow corridor. 
他们进入高原上狭窄的裂缝后，沿着洞穴陡峭的边往下爬直到他们来到一处狭窄的通道
They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. 
他们必须沿着这通道慢慢前进，有时趟过浅溪，或是游过深水池
Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. 
突然他们来一个流进洞穴底部地下湖的瀑布前
They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. 
他们纵身跳进湖中，然后在充气橡皮艇上安装传动装置，让水流带他们到对岸
To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. 
为了在冰冷的水中保护自己，他们必须穿上特殊的橡胶潜水服
At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. 
在离湖的尽头很远的地方，他们来到被水充倒的巨大的乱石堆
In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. 
在洞穴的这部份，他们能听到持续的轰响声，他发现是因为一个强大的小水柱从洞顶往下注入水池
Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. 
从岩石裂缝中挤过，洞穴探险者们到达了一个巨大的溶洞，有一个巨大音乐厅大小
After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. 
打开弧光灯之后，他们看到了大型石笋，有一些超过40英尺高
Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow. 
四周是一堆堆的石灰石，像彩虹一样闪闪发光
In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.
在这个寂静的可怕的洞穴中，唯一能听到的是穹顶上面滴下的水声

It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives.
对洞穴探险者来说，洞穴有一种特殊的魅力，就像高山对登山者有特殊魅力一样
For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber.
洞穴所引发的（探险）本能，只可意会，不可言传
They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.

探测非常深的洞穴不是那些在星期日下午漫步的人所能胜任的
Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler.
这种活动需要有军事行动般的周密布署和预见能力
Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations.
有时需要花费整整8天时间来搭起绳梯，建立供应基地，然后才能到一个很深的洞穴里
It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave.
作出这样的准备是必要的，因为无法预见到洞穴探险者究竟会遇到什么性质的困难
Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer.
世界上最深的洞穴是格里诺布尔附近的高弗.伯杰洞，
The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble.
深达3,723英尺
It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet.
这个深邃的洞穴是由一条地下暗泉冲刷岩石中的缝隙并使之慢慢变大而形成的
This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks.
此洞的洞口在丹芬阿尔卑斯山的高原上，
The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps.
仅6英尺宽，很难被发现
As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable.
若不是法国著名洞穴探险家伯杰由于偶然的机会发现了这个洞口的话，这个洞也许不会为人所知
The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger.
自从被发现以后，这个洞成了洞穴探险者的珠穆朗玛峰，
Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers' Everest.
人们多次进入洞内探险，但至今尚有不少东西有待勘探。
Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.

最近，一队洞穴探险者下到了高弗.伯杰洞里
A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffer Berger.
他们从高原上的窄缝进去，顺着笔直陡峭的洞壁往下爬。来到一条狭窄的走廊上
After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor.
他们不得不侧着身子往前走，有时过浅溪，有时游过深潭
They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools.
突然，他们来到一道瀑布前，那瀑布奔泻而下，注入洞底一处地下湖里
Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an undergroud lake at the bottom of the cave.
他们跳入湖中，把各种器具装上一只充气的橡皮艇，听任水流将他们带往对岸
They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side.
湖水冰冷刺骨，他们必须穿上一种特制的橡皮服以保护自己
To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits.
在湖的尽头，他们见到一大堆一大堆由湖水冲刷上岸的碎石
At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water.
在这儿，他们可以听见一种连续不断的轰鸣声。后来他们发现这是由山洞顶部的一个小孔里喷出的水柱跌落到水潭中发出的声音
At this part of the cave, they could hear an sistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave.
洞穴探险者从岩石缝里挤身过去，来到一个巨大的洞里，其大小相当于一个音乐厅
Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall.
他们打开强力弧光灯，看见一株株巨大的石笋，有的高达40英尺，像树干似地向上长着，与洞顶悬挂下来的钟乳石相接
After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites --- some of them over forty feet high --- rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof.
周围是一堆堆石灰石，像彩虹一样闪闪发光
Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow.
洞里有一种可怕的寂静，唯一的可以听见的声响是高高的圆顶上不间断地滴水的嘀嗒声
In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.

Lesson 43 Fully insured
第43课 全保险

Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. 
保险公司通常愿意为任何事情提供保险
Insuring public or private property is a standard practice in most countries in the world. 
为公共或私有财产投保在世界上大多数国家是一个标准惯例
If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. 
然而，如果你要举办一个露天游园派对或一个游乐会为你万一遇到恶劣天气保险也是同样可以的
Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. 
不必说，保险公司的风险越高，保费就越贵
It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for cost of salvaging a sunken ship. 
听到一家轮船公司为打捞沉船而索赔是一件再正常不过的事了
But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.
但是当地政府为了打捞一个沉没的平底盘子而索赔肯定是独一无二的
Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. 
公认它不是一个普通的平底盘，因为足有八十英尺长，六英尺厚
It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. 
它被一个地方当局购买了，因此一年一度的交易会可以烘烤一个巨大的饼
The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip. 
馅饼委员会决定运输这个盘子的最好方式是通过运河，因此他们为这趟旅程给盘子投了保
Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. 
馅饼推出不久之后，馅饼委员会走向当地一家酒店去庆祝
At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own. 
与此同时，一群十几岁的少年爬上盘子，（握住他们各自的一小部分）开办party
Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.
他们跳起了舞，盘子再也无法承受晃动，在派对期间它倾覆了沉入七英尺深的水中

　　The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish. 
馅饼委员会打电给当地一家修车厂老板，他开着一辆抢修车前来打捞这个盘子
Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. 
当三个男人不断地潜入水中定位这个盘子，这些十几岁的少年浑身湿淋淋中颤抖着在旁边看着
They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem. 
他们找到盘子没什么难度，但是把它拖出水面证明是一个严的问题
The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. 
这个盘子的边沿是如此的光滑，以致于要在边沿系上缆绳和铁链而不损坏它几乎是不可能
Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. 
最终铁链被固定在盘子的一个末尾，一辆强力绞车投入运转
The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. 
盘子升出了水面，并被轻轻的拖向运河岸边
For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water. 
盘子处于不稳固的运河岸边，就在提心吊胆的瞬间，它突然失去平衡滑回了水里
The men were now obliged to try once more. 
这些人现在不得不再试一次
This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. 
这次他们用金属夹子牢牢夹住盘子的两边，因此他们可以锁好铁链
The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. 
盘子现在必须被垂直抬起，因为一边正顶着运河的一边
The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. 
绞车再次投入运转，他们中的一个人启动卡车
Several minutes later, the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water. 
几分钟后，盘子被成功的拖出水面
Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. 
水流从它的四周激射而出，在运河里激起了巨大的浪花
There was danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. 
这是很危险的，波浪会弹回到河岸的另一侧把盘子再次落入水中
By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.
通过快速的作业，这些人成功的把盘子弄到陆地上就在波浪返回时

Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything.
承办公共财产或私人财产保险是世界上大部分国家的正常业务
Insuring public or private property is standard practice in most countries in the world.
如果你要举办一次露天游园会或盛宴，为避免碰上不好的天气而遭受损失也同样可以保险，
If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather.
不用说，保险公司承担风险越大，你付的保险费也就越高
Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay.
航运公司为打捞沉船而提出索赔，这是常有的事
It is not uncommen to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for the cost of salvaging a sunken ship.
但某地当局为打捞一只焙制馅饼的盘子提出索赔，倒是件新鲜的事儿
But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.

这个馅饼盘子确实少见，有18英尺长，6英尺宽
Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide.
某地方当局买下它用来焙制一个巨大的馅饼为一年一度交易会助兴
It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair.
馅饼委员会确认运输这只盘子的最佳方案是通过运河水运,于是，他们对这只盘子的运输安全投了保
The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip.
盘子下水后不久，馅饼委员会成员们来到当地一家小酒店庆贺
Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate.
就在这个时候，许多十几岁的孩子爬盘子举行他们自己的集会
At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own.
他们跳起了舞，盘子难以承受。舞会进行过程中，盘子倾覆，沉入了7英尺深的水中
Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.

　　馅饼委员会给当地汽车修理库老板打电话，他闻讯后开着一辆急修车前来打捞盘子
The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish.
那些孩子们穿着湿衣服哆嗦，看着3个工人轮潜入水中以确定盘子的位置
Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish.
他们没费多大事儿就找到了盘子。可是把盘子捞出却是一个很大的难题
They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem.
盘子四边十分光滑，要在盘边拴上绳索或链条而同时又不损坏它是很难办到的
The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it.
不过，他们终于将链条固定在盘子的一端，一台大功率的绞车开动起来
Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation.
盘子慢慢浮出水面，被轻轻地拽向运河岸边
The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank.
在令人忐忑不安的瞬间，盘子晃晃悠悠地上了岸，但它突然失去了平衡又跌回水中
For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water.
工人们只得再来一次
The men were now obliged to try once more.
这次，他们用沉重的金属夹子把盘子夹住，以便往盘子上安装铁链
This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains.
这次，盘子必须垂直吊出水面，因为盘子的一边紧靠着运河河岸
The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal.
绞盘机再次启动，一位工人发动了急修车的引擎
The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck.
几分钟后，盘子被成功地拽出了水面
Several minutes later, the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water.
波浪从盘子两侧急涌而出，在运河里掀起一股大浪
Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal.
但是当波浪从河对岸折回来时，就有再次把盘子拖进水里的危险
There was a danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again.
工人们动作迅速，终于赶在那股大浪返回之前把盘子拽到了岸上

   这个馅饼盘子确实少见，有18英尺长，6英尺宽
Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide.
某地方当局买下它用来焙制一个巨大的馅饼为一年一度交易会助兴
It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair.
馅饼委员会确认运输这只盘子的最佳方案是通过运河水运,于是，他们对这只盘子的运输安全投了保
The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip.
盘子下水后不久，馅饼委员会成员们来到当地一家小酒店庆贺
Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate.
就在这个时候，许多十几岁的孩子爬盘子举行他们自己的集会
At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own.
他们跳起了舞，盘子难以承受。舞会进行过程中，盘子倾覆，沉入了7英尺深的水中
Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.

　　馅饼委员会给当地汽车修理库老板打电话，他闻讯后开着一辆急修车前来打捞盘子
The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish.
那些孩子们穿着湿衣服哆嗦，看着3个工人轮潜入水中以确定盘子的位置
Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish.
他们没费多大事儿就找到了盘子。可是把盘子捞出却是一个很大的难题
They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem.
盘子四边十分光滑，要在盘边拴上绳索或链条而同时又不损坏它是很难办到的
The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it.
不过，他们终于将链条固定在盘子的一端，一台大功率的绞车开动起来
Eventually chians were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation.
盘子慢慢浮出水面，被轻轻地拽向运河岸边
The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank.
在令人忐忑不安的瞬间，盘子晃晃悠悠地上了岸，但它突然失去了平衡又跌回水中
For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water.
工人们只得再来一次
The men were now obliged to try once more.
这次，他们用沉重的金属夹子把盘子夹住，以便往盘子上安装铁链
This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains.
这次，盘子必须垂直吊出水面，因为盘子的一边紧靠着运河河岸
The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal.
绞盘机再次启动，一位工人发动了急修车的引擎
The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck.
几分钟后，盘子被成功地拽出了水面
Several minutes later, the dish was successful hauled above the surface of the water.
波浪从盘子两侧急涌而出，在运河里掀起一股大浪
Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal.
但是当波浪从河对岸折回来时，就有再次把盘子拖进水里的危险
There was a danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again.
工人们动作迅速，终于赶在那股大浪返回之前把盘子拽到了岸上
By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.

During the day, sleep comes in snatches. 
白天，睡眠来的断断续续
At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. 
在晚上，当你真的想睡的时候，你却很难睡着

没有多少人会为享受坐船旅行的乐趣而牺牲假期的时间
Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travelling by sea.

　　飞机以危险而著称，连老资格的旅行者也怕飞机
Aeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by them.
飞机另一个缺点是昂贵
They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport.
但就速度与舒适而言，飞机是无与伦比的
But nothing can match them for speed and comfort.
腾云驾雾，在30，000 英尺高空以500英里的时速旅行，这种经历令人心旷神怡
Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience.
你不必想办法去摆脱旅途的困扰，因为飞机会迅速地把你送到目的地
You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly.
几小时之内，你躺在扶手椅上，享受着旅途的欢乐
For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight.
真正会享受的人还可以在某些航班上看一场电影和喝香槟
The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services.
即使没有这些消遣条件，也总是有事可做
But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied.
飞机上，你可以观察世界上非同寻常的奇妙的美景
An aeroplane offers an unusual and breathtaking view of the world.
你毫不费劲地飞越高山幽谷，
You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys.
你确能饱览大地的风貌
You really see the shape of the land.
如果这种景色被遮住了，你可以观赏一下展现在你面前的、一望数英里的、连绵不断的云海，同时阳光灿烂，天空清澈明朗
If the landscape is hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky.
旅途平稳，丝毫不妨碍你阅读或睡眠
The journey is so smooth that it is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping.
不管你打算如何消磨时间，有件事是可以肯定的，即当你抵达目的地时，你感到精神焕发，毫无倦意，
However you decide to spend you time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled.
用不着因为漫长的旅途的辛苦而花几天时间休息来恢复精神。
You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.


第44课 又快捷又舒适
Lesson 44 Speed and comfort

出远门的人常常需要决定是走旱路、水路，还是坐飞机
People travelling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land, sea, or air.
很少有人能够真正喜欢坐几个小时以上的火车
Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours.
车厢很快就变得拥挤、闷热，
Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy.
想摆脱开旅途的困扰是很难的
It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey.
看书只能解决部分问题。车轮与铁轨间单调的嘎喳声很快就会送你进入梦乡
Reading is only a partial solution, for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep.
白天是忽睡忽醒，
During the day, sleep comes in snatches.
到了夜晚，你真想睡了，却很难入睡
At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so.
即使你走运弄到一个卧铺，夜间有一半时间你会盯着车顶那盏小蓝灯而睡不着觉;要不然就为查票摸索你的车票
If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find your ticket for inspection.
一旦抵达目的地，你总是疲惫不堪
Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted.
乘汽车作长途旅行则更加不舒服，因为连看书都几乎不可能
Lang car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read.
在高速公路上还好，你至少能以相当快的速度安全地向前行,但旅行的大部分时间都花在路上，而且只有很少的服务设施，交通也很拥挤。
On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic.
相比之下，坐船旅行或环游可以得到文明世界的各种享受。
By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts.
你可以在甲板上伸展四肢、做游戏，还能也很见到各种有趣的人，能享用各种美味佳肴——当然，这一切只有在大海风平浪静的情况下才有可能。
You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food, always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm.
如果大海肆虐起来，你就可能晕船，那种难受劲儿是任何一种别的旅行的方式都不会带来的
If it is not, and you are likely to get seasick, no form of transport could be worse.
即使风平浪静，坐船旅行也要占用很长时间
Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time.
没有多少人会为享受坐船旅行的乐趣而牺牲假期的时间
Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travelling by sea.

Lesson 46 Do it yourself
第46课 自己动手(DIY)

　Did the writer repair his lawn mower in the end? Why/Why not?
 作者最终修好他的割草机了吗？为什么没有？

　　So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour. 
我们对做自己的事是如此的有激情，以至我们变得越来越少依赖专门的工人
No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for these are countless do-it-yourself publications.
再也没有借口说没有专门的知识了，因为有无数的DIY教材
Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. 
装备好合适的工具和材料，新婚夫妇轻松地着手装饰他们自己的家
Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture. 
特别是男人常利用空闲时间安装壁炉，布置花园，构建车库和制作家具
Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. 
有些真正的狂热爱好者甚至制造自己的电脑
Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. 
商店为了迎合这些狂热的DIY们不仅为初学者提供专门的咨询服务，而且向消费者提供可以在家里组装的零部件
Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.
这些事为被压抑的创造力提供了一个很好的宣泄口，但不幸的是并不是所有人都天生手巧

　　Some wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. 
   一些妻子往往会觉得她们丈夫是万能的，什么都能修
Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics. 
即使一根钉子都打不直的男人也被认为是天生的电工，木匠，水管工和机修工
When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some woman assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. 
当电灯保险比熔断，家具摇晃，水管堵塞或者吸尘器不工作，一些妇女认业她们的丈夫总是可以摆平
The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. 
关于DIY最糟糕的事情是有时甚至男人也活在幻想中，觉得他们无所不能，即使他们不断被证明是错的
It is a question of pride as much as anything else.
它是一个面子问题
　　Last spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower. 
   去年春天我妻子建议我去叫一个人来看一下我们的割草机
It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. 
它前年夏天坏了，我一直保证修好它，但我一直没有抽出时间来
I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself. 
我将再也不会听到这个建议，说我自己来修它
One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the machine into the garden and had a close look at it. 
一个星期六的下午，我拉着割草机进了花园仔细的看了看
As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new. 
就我看到而言，它只需要一点小调整，这里拧一下螺丝，那里加固一下，滴点润滑油，它就能像新一样工作的很好
Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. 
然而修理工作不是如此简单的
The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it. 
割草机顽固的拒绝割草，因此我决定拆开它
The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawn mower. 
花园很快到处散乱着割草机零件
But I was extremely pleased with myself. 
但是我自己是极其高兴的
I had traced the cause of the trouble. 
我已经找到问题的原因
One of links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. 
驱动轮子的链条中有一个链接部件已经断裂
After buying a new chain I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again. 
买了一个新链条之生，我面临无法完成的任务：把让人晕头转向的拼图再次组合
I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it, for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere. 
我并不惊讶的发现我重新组装割草机后仍然不工作，因为简单的判断是我留下几个奇怪的形状的金属部件他们看起来装在哪都不合适
I gave up in despair.
在绝望中我放弃了
 The weeks passed and the grass grew. 
 几个星期过去了，草长起来了
 When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow. 
 当我的妻子唠叨我要把草割了，我告诉字她要么我必须买一台新的割草机要么让草继续长
 Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle. 
 不必说我们的房子现在已经杂草丛生了
 Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.
埋在草坪深处某个地方，有一台我曾经保证一天要修好的已锈迹斑斑的割草机

第46课 自己动手
Lesson 46 Do it yourself

现在我们自己动手做事的热情很高，结果对于专业工人的依赖越来越少了
So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour.
由于出版了不计其数的教人自己动手做事的书报杂志，没有人再能说对某事一无所知
No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for there are countless do-it-yourself publications.
新婚夫妇找来合适的工具和材料，喜气洋洋地开始布置新房。
Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes.
特别是男人，常利用空闲时间安装壁炉、布置花园、建造车库、制作家具
Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own firplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture.
有些热衷于自己动手的人甚至自己组装电脑
Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers.
为了满足自己动手热的需要，商店不仅为初学者提供专门的咨询服务，而且为顾客准备了各种零件，供他们买回家去安装
Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home.
这些东西为人们潜在的创造力提供了一个绝妙的用武之地, 但不幸的是，我们并非人人都是能工巧匠
Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.

　　妻子常常认为她们的丈夫无比聪明能干
Some wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything.
甚至那些连一枚钉子都钉不直的男人都被认为是天生的电工、木匠、水管工和机械师
Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics.
每当电灯保险丝烧断、家具榫头松动、管道堵塞、吸尘器不动时，有些妻子认为丈夫总有办法
When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some women assume that their husbands will somehow put things right.
自己动手的例子中最糟糕的是，有时甚至是男人尽管接连失败却还误以为自己什么都行，
The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong.
原因就是要面子。
It is a question of pride as much as anything else.
　　今年春天，妻子让我请人检查一下我家的割草机
Last spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower.
那台割草机去年夏天就坏了，尽管我答应修，但一直没抽出时间，
It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it.
我不愿听妻子的建议，说我自己会修
I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself.
一个星期六的下午，我把割草机拉到了花园里，仔细检查了一番
One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the machine into the garden and have a close look at it.
在我看来，只需稍加调整即可。这儿紧紧螺丝，那儿固定一下，再加几滴油，就会像新的一样了
As fas as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new.
事实上，修理工作远不是那么简单
Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple.
修完后割草机还是纹丝不动, 于是，我决定把它拆开
The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it.
一会儿工夫，割草机便被拆成一个个金属零件，乱七八糟地堆在花园里
The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawn mower.
但我却非常高兴，
But I was extremely pleased with myself.
因为我找到了毛病所在。
I had traced the cause of the trouble.
驱动轮子的链条断了一节
One of the links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped.
我买来一根新链条后，面临的就是如何把这些令人眼花缭乱的拼板重新组装起来
After buying a new chain, I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again.
等我装完后，那台割草机仍然一动不动，对此我倒并不感到吃惊,
I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had assembled it,
原因很简单，因为还剩下几个形状奇特的零件似乎哪里也装不上去。
for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere.
我无可奈何，只好罢休。
I gave up in dispair.
几个星期过去了，草长了起来。
The weeks passed and the grass grew.
妻子喋喋不休让我想点办法, 我告诉她，要么买一台新割草机，要么让草长下去。
When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow.
不用说，我家现在已被丛林包围。
Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle.
深草丛中的某个地方有一台正在生锈的割草机，那就是我曾答应某日要修理的割草机。
Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.



第46课 自己动手
Lesson 46 Do it yourself

现在我们自己动手做事的热情很高，结果对于专业工人的依赖越来越少了
So great is our passion for doing thins for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour.
由于出版了不计其数的教人自己动手做事的书报杂志，没有人再能说对某事一无所知
No one can plead ingorance of a subject any longer, that there are countless do-it-yourself publications.

Lesson 47 Too high a price?
第47课，代价太高？

Pollution is the price we pay for an overpopulated, over industrialized planet. 
污染是我们为人口密集过度工业化的星球付出的代价
When you come to think about it, there are only four ways you can deal with rubbish: dump it, burn it, turn it into something you can use again, attempt to produce less of it. 
当你开始思考它的时候，你只有四种处理垃圾：丢掉，烧掉，做成一些东西再利用，减少产生垃圾
We keep trying all four methods, but the sheer volume of rubbish we produce worldwide threatens to overwhelm us.
我们一直尝试这四种方法，但是我们全世界产生的垃圾数量威胁使我们不知所措
　　Rubbish, however, is only part of the problem of polluting our planet. 
   然而，垃圾只是我们的星球污染问题的一部分
The need to produce ever-increasing quantities of cheap food leads to a different kind of pollution. 
廉价食品不断增长的需求导致不同类型的污染
Industrialized farming methods produce cheap meat products: beef, pork and chicken. 
工业化农业方式产生了廉价的肉类产品：牛肉，猪肉和鸡肉
The use of pesticides and fertilizers produces cheap grain and vegetables. 
农药和化肥的使用生产了廉价的谷物和蔬菜
The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease (BSE) in cattle, salmonella in chicken and eggs, and listeria in dairy products. 
我们为廉价食品付的代价可能已经太高：牛中的疯牛病，鸡和蛋中沙门氏菌，乳制品中的利斯特杆菌
And if you think you'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian, you have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you think you're eating fresh salads and vegetables, or just having an innocent glass of water!
如果你认为你准备放弃肉类变成一个素食主义者，你可以两者择其一，选用昂贵的有机蔬菜，或是当你认为你正在享用新鲜的沙拉和蔬菜或喝一杯无害的水时实际上每次不断地吃进杀虫剂
　　However, there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban areas and invades our daily lives, and that is noise. 
然而，一种更隐蔽的污染特别影响城区侵入我们的每天生活，那就是噪音
Burglar alarms going off at any time of the day or night serve only to annoy passers-by and actually assist burglars to burgle. 
防盗报警器不分白天黑夜随时响起也仅仅让路人恼怒，实际上帮助了盗贼入室盗窃
Car alarms constantly scream at us in the street and are a source of profound irritation. 
汽车防盗报警器总是尖叫在我们的街道是一个极其烦躁的来源
A recent survey of the effects of noise revealed (surprisingly?) that dogs barking incessantly in the night rated the highest form of noise pollution on a scale ranging from 1 to 7. 
最近一项噪音影响调查显示（出人意料？）狗不停地叫在晚上被认为是最高级的噪音污染，从1-7的等级
The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike. 
这项调查揭露了我们厌恶的大量的噪音源
Lawn mowers whining on a summer's day, late-night parties in apartment blocks, noisy neighbors, vehicles of all kinds, especially large container trucks thundering through quiet village, planes and helicopters flying overhead, large radios carried round in public places and played at maximum volume. 
割草机唠叨一整个夏天，公寓大楼深夜的party，吵闹的邻居，各种各样的车子，尤其是大集装箱货车如雷般穿过安静的村庄，飞机和直升机飞过头顶，巨大的音响传遍公共场所而且把音量开到最大播放
New technology has also made its own contribution to noise. 
新技术也为噪音做了贡献
A lot of people object to mobile phones, especially when they are used in public places like restaurants or on public transport. 
许多人反对手机，尤其是在公共场合，像在餐厅，公共交通上
Loud conversations on mobile phones invade our thoughts or interrupt the pleasure of meeting friends for a quiet chat. 
大声用手机交谈，侵扰了我们的思想或是打断我们和朋友的窃窃私语
The noise pollution survey revealed a rather spurring and possibly amusing old fashioned source of noise. 
噪音污染调查揭露出一个相当刺激可能好笑的老式的噪音源
It turned out to be snoring! Men were found to be the worst offenders. 
它竟然是打鼾，男人被发现是罪魁祸首
It was revealed that 20% of men in their mid-thirties snore. 
它揭露20%男人在35岁左右会打鼾
This figure rises to a staggering 60% of men in their sixties. 
这个数字在男人们60岁的时候上升到惊人的60%
Against these figures, it was found that only 5% of women snore regularly, while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their trumpeting partners. 
相对于这些数字，调查发现只有5%的妇女会打鼾， 当她们的喇叭搭档吵醒她们或是让她们睡不着时
Whatever the source of noise, one thing is certain: silence, it seems, has become a golden memory.
无论是什么噪音，一件事是肯定的：安静似乎已经变成一种金色的记忆

The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease (BSE) in cattle, salmonella in chicken and eggs, and listeria in dairy products.
如果你想放弃肉类而变成一位素食者，那么你可以两者择一：或是选用价格昂贵、有机培植的蔬菜，或是当你认为在享用新鲜色拉和新鲜蔬菜或饮用一杯无害的水的时候，实际上每次都不断吃进杀虫剂
And if you think you'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian, you have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you think you're eating fresh salads and vegetables, or just having an innocent glass of water.
　　但是，还有一种更加隐蔽有害的污染，它专门影响城镇地区，侵袭我们的日常生活，那就是噪音
However, there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban areas and invades our daily lives, and that is noise.
防盗警报器在白天和黑夜的任何时候都会响起来，它的作用只是骚扰过路行人，而实际上却帮助窃贼入室行窃

在街上，汽车的防盗警报不断对我们吼叫，这是人们极度烦燥的一个原因，
Car alarms constantly scream at us in the street and are a source of profound irritation.
最近一个有关噪音的作用的调查(令人吃惊地)指出，夜间连续不断的狗叫声，在一个从1级至7级刻度表上应列为最严重的噪间污染
A recent survey of the effects of noise revealed (surprisingly) that dogs barking incessantly in the night rated the highest form of noise pollution on a scale ranging from 1 to 7.
这个调查揭示了我们所不喜欢的大量的噪音：
The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike.
夏天呜呜作响的割草机，公寓楼里深夜聚会的喧哗声，大声吵闹的邻居，各式各样的车辆，特别是穿越寂静的村庄的集装箱卡车，从头顶飞过的飞机和直升机，被带到公共场所、音量开到最大的大功率收音机
Lawn mowers whining on a summer's day, late-night parties in apartment blocks, noisy neighbours, vehicles of all kinds, especially large container trucks thundering through quiet villages, planes and helicopters flying overhead, large radios carried round in public places and played at maximum volume.
新技术也为噪音作了它的贡献。
New technology has also made its own contribution to noise.

The noise pollution survey revealed a rather surprising and possibly amusing old-fashioned source of noise.
它竟然是鼾声
It turned out to be snoring!
男人是这方面的罪魁祸首
Men were found to be the worst offenders.
调查指出，20%的35岁左右的男人打鼾;
It was revealed that 20% of men in their mid-thirties snore.
而到60岁这个年龄段，这个数字上升到令人惊愕的60%

与这些数字相比，只有5% 的女性经常打鼾;而其余则经常被与她们同睡、像吹号似地打着呼噜的男人吵醒或弄得睡不着
Against these figures, it was found that only 5% of women snore regularly, while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their trumpeting partners.
不管噪声来自何方，有一点是肯定的：看来寂静已变成一种珍贵的回忆
Whatever the source of noise, one thing is certain: silence, it seems, has become a golden memory.

这个调查揭示了我们所不喜欢的大量的噪音：
The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike.
夏天呜呜作响的割草机，公寓楼里深夜聚会的喧哗声，大声吵闹的邻居，各式各样的车辆，特别是穿越寂静的村庄的集装箱卡车，从头顶飞过的飞机和直升机，被带到公共场所、音量开到最大的大功率收音机
Lawn mowers whining on a summer's day, late-night parties in apartment blocks, noisy neighbours, vehicles of all kinds, especially large container trucks thundering through quiet villages, planes and helicopters flying overhead, large radios carried round in public places and played at maximum volume.
新技术也为噪音作了它的贡献。
New technology has also made its own contribution to noise.
许多人都反对移动式电话，特别是在如饭店，公共交通车等公共场所使用移动电话

The noise pollution survey revealed a rather surprising and possibly amusing old-fashioned source of noise.
它竟然是鼾声
It turned out to be snoring!
男人是这方面的罪魁祸首
Men were found to be the worst offenders.
调查指出，20%的35岁左右的男人打鼾;
It was revealed that 20% of men in their mid-thirties snore.
而到60岁这个年龄段，这个数字上升到令人惊愕的60%
This figure rises to a staggering 60% of men in their sixties.
与这些数字相比，只有5% 的女性经常打鼾;而其余则经常被与她们同睡、像吹号似地打着呼噜的男人吵醒或弄得睡不着
Against these figures, it was found that only 5% of women snore regularly, while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their trumpeting partners.
不管噪声来自何方，有一点是肯定的：看来寂静已变成一种珍贵的回忆
Whatever the source of noise, one thing is certain: silence, it seems, has become a golden memory.


第47课 代价太高？
Lesson 47 Too high a price

   污染就是我们为这个人口过密，过度工业化的星球所付出的代价
   Pollution is the price we pay for an overpopulated, over industrialized planet.
当我们开始考虑垃圾问题时，我们只有4种对付垃圾的方法：倾倒、焚烧、把垃圾变成再生材料或试图少产生一些垃圾
When you come to think about it, there are only four ways you can deal with rubbish: dump it, burn it, turn it into something you can use again, attempt to produce less of it.
我们一直在试这4种方式，但是，我们在世界范围内仅产生的垃圾的量就有把我们覆盖的危险
We keep trying all four methods, but the sheer volume of rubbish we produce worldwide threatens to overwhelm us.
　　然而，垃圾只是我们这个星球的污染问题的一个方面
   Rubbish, however, is only part of the problem of polluting our planet.
日益增长的对廉价食物的需求导致了另一种形式的污染
The need to produce ever-inceasing quantities cheap food leads to a different kind of pollution.
工业化的农作方式生产出廉价的肉类制品——牛肉、猪肉和鸡肉
Industrialized farming methods produce cheap meat products: beef, pork and chicken.
使用杀虫剂和化肥生产出廉价的谷物和蔬菜
The use of pesticides and fertilizers produces cheap grain and vegetables.
为了廉价食物我们付出代价已经太高了：牛肉中的疯牛病，鸡肉和鸡蛋中的沙门氏菌，奶制品中的利斯特杆菌
The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease (BSE) in cattle, salmonella in chicken and eggs and listera in dairy products.
如果你想放弃肉类而变成一位素食者，那么你可以两者择一：或是选用价格昂贵、有机培植的蔬菜，或是当你认为在享用新鲜色拉和新鲜蔬菜或饮用一杯无害的水的时候，实际上每次都不断吃进杀虫剂
And if you think you'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian, you have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you think you're eat fresh salads and vegetables, or just having an innocent glass of water.
　　但是，还有一种更加隐蔽有害的污染，它专门影响城镇地区，侵袭我们的日常生活，那就是噪音
   However, there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban area and invades our daily lives, and that is noise.
防盗警报器在白天和黑夜的任何时候都会响起来，它的作用只是骚扰过路行人，而实际上却帮助窃贼入室行窃

Lesson 48 The silent village
第48课 沉默的村庄
　　In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists. 
   在如今这个丰富的旅游世界，仍然有成千上万的地方旅游者难以到达的
We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. 
我们总是认为偏远地区村民是友好好客的
But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. 
但是那些不但与外国的游客隔绝，而且甚至和他们自己同胞也隔绝的人们会敌视旅行者
Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.
到真正偏远的村庄旅游并不愉快，我和我的妻子和我穿越巴尔干半岛时深有体会
　　We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. 
   我们在一个小镇渡过几天，在周边参观了很多老教堂
These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. 
这些教堂吸引了很多观光者，因为他们不仅有很多建筑的趣味，而且也包含很多保存完好的美丽壁画
On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town.
在我离开的前一天，几辆巴士载着游客来到小镇
This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. 
这让我们无法忍受，因此我们决定最后再花一天探索这个乡村
Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. 
我们找到一条出去镇子的小路，我们穿过几片田野来到一处密林
We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. 
我们预计小路会突然中断，但是我们发现它跟着穿过这些树林
We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. 
我们长途跋涉了两个多小时穿越树林才来到一条深深的小溪
We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. 
我们能看到这条小路一直延续到另一边，但是我们没有办法穿越这条小溪
Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. 
突然我妻子看到一条小船停泊在岸边
In it there was a boatman fast asleep. 
在里面有一位船夫睡的正香
We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. 
我们轻声唤醒他，请他渡我们到对岸去
Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.
一开始他不情愿，但是我们最终说服了他渡我们
　　The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. 
   这条小路通往坐落在陡峭山边的一个小村庄
The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. 
这个地方由一条没修的土路蔓延组成，路的两有一些小房子
Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. 
即使在晴朗的蓝天下，这个村庄看起来也很阴森，因为所有的房子都是灰色泥砖建的
The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. 
村子看起来空无一人，仅有的生命是一只看起来很丑的黑山羊用短绳系在附近一块地里的树上
Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. 
在靠近这片田地倒塌的木篱笆坐下，我们打开几罐沙丁鱼罐头，野餐了一顿
All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. 
突然，我看到我妻子充满了警惕
Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. 
抬起头我看到我们正被一群衣衫褴褛的小孩包围，他们正默默地看着我们吃东西
We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. 
我给他们拿了食物，轻轻地和他们说话，但是他们还是静静的看着我们
I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. 
我推断他们只是陌生人的害羞
When we later walked down the main street of the villager, we were followed by a silent procession of children. 
当我们随后走下村庄的主要街道时，我们后面跟着一队沉默的孩子
The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. 
这个看起来荒芜的村子，立即开始有了生命
Faces appeared at windows. 
一张张脸出现在窗子上
Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. 
穿着短袖的男人站在他们房子外面瞪着我们
Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. 
带着黑色披肩的老妇女从门廊里盯着
The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. 
最可怕的事情是我们听不到一点声音
There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. 
毫无疑问我们是不受欢迎的参观者
We needed no further warning. 
我们不需要更多的警告
Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.
转回主街道，我们加快速度迅速朝我们小溪走去，希望船夫还在等我们

第48课 沉默的村庄
Lesson 48 The silent village

   在这个旅游频繁的世界上，仍有成千上万个游人足迹未至的地方
   In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists.
人们总是以为偏僻的地方的村民们热情好客
We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable.
但是，那些不但与外国旅游者隔绝，而且与本国同胞隔绝的人们有可能对游客抱有敌意
But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers.
到真正偏僻的村庄去旅游并不是一件愉快的事情, 我与妻子在一次周游巴尔干半岛时对此深有体会
Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable, as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.
　　我们在一座小镇上逗留了几天，参观了附近的许多古老的教堂
   We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity.
这些教堂吸引大量游客，不仅是因为建筑风格奇特，而且还有大量保存完好的壁画
These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architecture interest, but contained a large of beautifully preserved frescoes as well.
我们离开小镇的前一天，镇上来了几辆满载游客的公共汽车
On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town.
人多得使我们难以忍受，于是我们决定利用最后一天去乡间一游
This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside.
我们走上了一条出镇的小路，穿过几块农田，来到一片茂密的树林
Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood.
我们原以为小路会到此突然终止,没想到它到树林中继续向前延伸
We expected that the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees.
我们在树林中跋涉了两个多小时，到了一条深溪边
We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream.
我们可以看到小路在深溪对岸继续向前伸展，但却不知如何越过这道深溪
We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream.
突然，妻子发现岸边泊着一条小船，
Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank.
船上有一船夫在呼呼大睡
In it there was a boatman fast asleep.
我们轻轻地把他唤醒，请他把我们摆渡过溪
We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side.
一开始，他很不愿意，但经劝说，终于同意了
Though he was reluctant to do so at first, eventually we persuaded him to take us.

　　顺着小路，我们来到一个座落在陡峭山坡上的小村庄
   The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain.
这儿有一条未经修筑的弯弯曲曲的道路，路两边排列着一些矮小的农舍
The place consisted of a straggle unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.
农舍全用灰色的土坯建成，因此，即使在晴朗的蓝天底下，村庄看上去也会令人感到难以亲近
Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks.
村里似乎无人居住，唯一的生命迹象是附近田里一只面目可憎的黑山羊，用一截短绳拴在一棵树上
The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby.
我们在田边一堵东倒西歪的篱笆墙上坐下来，打开几听沙丁鱼罐头，吃了一顿野外午餐
Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch.
突然，我注意到妻子十分惊恐
All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm.
我抬头一看，发现我们被一群衣衫褴褛的小孩团团围住了，他们在默不作声地看着我们吃饭
Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate.
我们给他们东西吃，客客气气地同他们交谈，但他们却一动也不动
We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless.
我认为这不过是他们在陌生人面前表现出的害羞
I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers.
后来，我们在村里的主要街道上行走的时候，一队默不作声的孩子跟在我们后头
When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children.
刚才还似乎空荡荡的村庄一下子活跃了起来，
The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life.
窗口露出了一张张面孔，
Faces appeared at windows.
只穿着衬衣的男人们站在屋子外面凶狠地盯着我们，
Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us.
披黑纱巾的老妇人站在门口偷偷地瞅着我们
Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways.
最令人害怕的是到处没有一点声音
The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard.
毫无疑问，我们的来访是不受欢迎的
There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors.
我们不需要进一步的警告了
We needed no further warning.
便掉转身子，沿着那条主要街道加快步伐，快速地朝深溪边走去，希望船夫还在那儿等着我们
Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.

We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream.
突然，妻子发现岸边泊着一条小船，
Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank.
船上有一船夫在呼呼大睡
In it there was a boatman fast asleep.
我们轻轻地把他唤醒，请他把我们摆渡过溪
We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side.
一开始，他很不愿意，但经劝说，终于同意了
Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.
　　顺着小路，我们来到一个座落在陡峭山坡上的小村庄
   The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain.
这儿有一条未经修筑的弯弯曲曲的道路，路两边排列着一些矮小的农舍
The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses.
农舍全用灰色的土坯建成，因此，即使在晴朗的蓝天底下，村庄看上去也会令人感到难以亲近
Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the hosues were built of grey mud bricks.
村里似乎无人居住，唯一的生命迹象是附近田里一只面目可憎的黑山羊，用一截短绳拴在一棵树上
The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby.
我们在田边一堵东倒西歪的篱笆墙上坐下来，打开几听沙丁鱼罐头，吃了一顿野外午餐
Sitting down on dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch.
突然，我注意到妻子十分惊恐
All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm.
我抬头一看，发现我们被一群衣衫褴褛的小孩团团围住了，他们在默不作声地看着我们吃饭
Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate.
我们给他们东西吃，客客气气地同他们交谈，但他们却一动也不动
We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless.
我认为这不过是他们在陌生人面前表现出的害羞
I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers.
后来，我们在村里的主要街道上行走的时候，一队默不作声的孩子跟在我们后头
When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children.
刚才还似乎空荡荡的村庄一下子活跃了起来，
The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life.
窗口露出了一张张面孔，
Faces appeared at windows.
只穿着衬衣的男人们站在屋子外面凶狠地盯着我们，
Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us.
披黑纱巾的老妇人站在门口偷偷地瞅着我们
Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways.
最令人害怕的是到处没有一点声音
The most frightening thing of all was that not sound could be heard.
毫无疑问，我们的来访是不受欢迎的
There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors.
我们不需要进一步的警告了
We needed no further warning.
便掉转身子，沿着那条主要街道加快步伐，快速地朝深溪边走去，希望船夫还在那儿等着我们
Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.

第48课 沉默的村庄
Lesson 48 The silent village

   在这个旅游频繁的世界上，仍有成千上万个游人足迹未至的地方
   In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists.
人们总是以为偏僻的地方的村民们热情好客
We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable.
但是，那些不但与外国旅游者隔绝，而且与本国同胞隔绝的人们有可能对游客抱有敌意
But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers.
到真正偏僻的村庄去旅游并不是一件愉快的事情, 我与妻子在一次周游巴尔干半岛时对此深有体会
Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.
　　我们在一座小镇上逗留了几天，参观了附近的许多古老的教堂
   We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity.
这些教堂吸引大量游客，不仅是因为建筑风格奇特，而且还有大量保存完好的壁画
These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large of beautifully preserved frescoes as well.
我们离开小镇的前一天，镇上来了几辆满载游客的公共汽车
On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town.
人多得使我们难以忍受，于是我们决定利用最后一天去乡间一游
This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside.
我们走上了一条出镇的小路，穿过几块农田，来到一片茂密的树林
Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we come to a dense wood.
我们原以为小路会到此突然终止,没想到它到树林中继续向前延伸
We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees.
我们在树林中跋涉了两个多小时，到了一条深溪边
We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream.
我们可以看到小路在深溪对岸继续向前伸展，但却不知如何越过这道深溪
We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream.

Lesson 49 The ideal servant
第49课 理想的仆人

　　It is a good thing my aunt Harriet died years ago. 
   我的姑妈哈丽特前几年过世了这倒是一件好事
If she were alive today she would not be able to air her views on her favourite topic of conversation: domestic servants. 
如果她现在还活着，她将不能表达她喜欢的话题：家庭仆人
Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework. 
哈丽特姑妈生活在一个悠闲年代，那时请了几个佣人做家务
She had a huge, rambling country house called 'The Gables'. 
她在乡下有一座巨大，杂乱的的房子叫：山墙庄园
She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death. 
这座房子对她非常有感情，因为即使房子对她来讲又大又远，她丈夫死后仍坚持在这里生活了很长时间
Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly. 
未老之前，哈丽特姑妈的娱乐生活是丰富多彩的
I often visited The Gables when I was boy. 
我小时候经常去山墙庄园
No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate. 
无所有多少客人出席，这座大房子总是洁净完美
The parquet floors shone like mirrors; 
木地板亮的像镜子
highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; 
擦的极其亮的银器陈列在闪闪发光的玻璃橱柜中
even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust. 
甚至我姑父收集的大量的书籍也是奇迹般的一尘不染
Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished. 
哈丽特姑妈掌管着一支隐形有仆人军队，他们不断地搽洗，清洁，搽亮
She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names. 
她总是谈及他们像是：不断变化的人口，因为他们流动的很频繁，我甚至从来没有机会知道他们的名字
Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please. 
在那时，尽管我姑妈算得上是一项开明的政策，因为她从来不允许她家员工一天工作超过8小时，但她是极其难以满意的
While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.
当她总是指责人家性格浮躁时，她在生命的最后还在继续进行无情寻找理想的的仆人，即使她幻想已经悲哀的被贝西破灭后
　　Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years. 
   贝西为合丽特姑妈工作了三年
During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence that she was put in charge of the domestic staff. 
在那期间她是如此的获得姑妈的信任，她被派去负责家里的佣人
Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie's industriousness and efficiency. 
哈丽特姑妈对贝西的勤勉和效率无法用言语来赞美
In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook. 
在她的其它任职资格外，贝西是一个烹饪能手
She acted the role of the perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her 'little weakness'. 
她扮演了一个完美无瑕的仆人三年直到哈丽特姑妈发现了她的一个小缺点
After being absent from the Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner.
一个星期没去山墙庄园后，姑妈出乎意料的在一个下午带着一批客人回来并指示贝西准备晚餐
No only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily. 
这一餐不仅比平时差，而且贝西看起来走不稳
She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests. 
她撞到了家具上，不停喃喃自语的说客人
When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force. 
当她带着最后一道菜一个巨大的布丁进来后，她绊倒在地毯上，布丁飞过空中刚好错过姑妈，重重的坠落在餐桌上
Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified. 
尽管这引起了客人的欢笑，但姑妈是心有余悸
She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk. 
她不情愿的推测贝西喝醉了
The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusement. 
客人们当然也早就从贝西为他们开门的那一刻看出来了，在好长一段是时间里，在最后那个那个乱子前，他们努力克制住才没笑出来
The poor girl was dismissed instantly. 
这个可怜的女孩马上被解雇了
After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie's wardrobe. 
她离开后，哈丽特姑妈发现一堆大大小小的空葡萄酒瓶整齐的堆放在贝西原来的衣柜中
They had mysteriously found their way there from the wine cellar!
这些酒瓶神不知鬼不觉的从酒窖中来到这里

第49课 理想的仆人
Lesson 49 The ideal servant


我的姑妈哈丽特好多年前就去世了，这倒是件好事
It is a good thing my aunt Harriet died years ago.
如果她活到今天，她将不能就她热衷的话题“佣人”发表意见了
If she were alive today she would not be able to air her views on her favourite topic of conversation: domestic servants.
哈丽特生活在一个悠闲的年代，家务事都由雇来的佣人代劳
Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework.
她在乡下有一幢巨大杂乱的房子，叫作“山墙庄园”
She had a huge, rambling country house called 'The Gables'.
她对这幢房子在感情上难舍难分, 房子实在太大了，但在丈夫去世多年后，她仍然执意长年住在那儿
She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death.
哈丽特姑妈年轻时，喜欢大摆宴席，招待宾客
Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly.
我小时候常去“山墙庄园”作客
I often visited The Gables when I was a boy.
不管去多少宾客，大房子里总是收拾得干干净净
No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate.
镶木地板洁如明镜，擦得发亮的银器陈列在明亮的玻璃柜里，连姑夫的大量藏书也保存得很好，奇迹般地一尘不染
The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass carbinets; even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust.
哈丽特姑妈统率着一支看不见的佣人大军，他们不停地擦拭、清扫、刷洗
Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned and polished.
她称这些佣人叫“流动人口”，因为他们来匆匆，所以我甚至都没有机会知道他们的姓名
She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names.
姑妈待佣人在当时算是开明的，从来不让佣人每天工作超过8小时，但他们很难使她称心如意
Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please.
她一方面总是批评人的本性朝三暮四，另一方面她又持之以恒地寻找一个理想的佣人。即使在贝西大大地伤她的心之后，她还在找，一直到她死去
While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.
　　贝西在哈丽特家干了3年
   Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years.
在此期间，她赢得了姑母的赏识，甚至当上了大管家
During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence that she was pud in charge of the domestic staff.
哈丽特不知该用什么言辞来赞扬贝西的勤奋与高效
Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie's industriousness and efficiency.
贝西除了有各种本领以外，还是一个烹饪大师
In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook.
她担任“理想仆人”角色3年之后，哈丽特终于发现她有“小小的弱点”
She acted the role of the perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her 'little' weakness.
一次，姑妈有一个星期没在“山墙庄园”住,一天下午，她出其不意地回来了，带来一大批客人，吩咐贝西准备晚饭
After being absent from The Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner.
结果，不仅饭菜远不如平时做得好，而且贝西走起路来似乎东倒西歪
Not only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily.
她撞到了家具上，嘴里还不断咕咕哝哝议论客人
She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests.
当她端着最后一道菜——一大盘布丁——走进屋来时，在地毯上绊了一跤, 布丁飞到半空，从姑母身边擦过，然后狠狠地砸在餐桌上
When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force.
这件事引起了客人们的欢笑，但哈丽特却着实吓了一跳
Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified.
她不得不认定贝西是喝醉了
She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk.
客人们自然从贝西为他们开门那一刻起就看出来了，在好长一段时间里，即最后这个乱子发生前，他们努力克制才没笑出声来
The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusemunt.
贝西当即被解雇了
The poor girl was dismissed instantly.
贝西走后，哈丽特姑妈发现在贝西以前用过的衣柜里整整齐齐地放着一堆堆形状各导、大小不一的酒瓶子
After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie's wardrope.
这些酒瓶神不知鬼不觉地从酒窖来到了这里。
They had mysteriously found their way there from the wine cellar!

She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death.
哈丽特姑妈年轻时，喜欢大摆宴席，招待宾客
Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entermain lavishly.
我小时候常去“山墙庄园”作客
I often visited The Gables when I was a boy.
不管去多少宾客，大房子里总是收拾得干干净净
No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate.
镶木地板洁如明镜，擦得发亮的银器陈列在明亮的玻璃柜里，连姑夫的大量藏书也保存得很好，奇迹般地一尘不染
The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass carbinets; even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust.
哈丽特姑妈统率着一支看不见的佣人大军，他们不停地擦拭、清扫、刷洗
Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned and polished.
她称这些佣人叫“流动人口”，因为他们来匆匆，所以我甚至都没有机会知道他们的姓名
She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names.
姑妈待佣人在当时算是开明的，从来不让佣人每天工作超过8小时，但他们很难使她称心如意
Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely a difficult to please.
她一方面总是批评人的本性朝三暮四，另一方面她又持之以恒地寻找一个理想的佣人。即使在贝西大大地伤她的心之后，她还在找，一直到她死去
While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on unrelenting seach for the deal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.
　　贝西在哈丽特家干了3年
   Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years.
在此期间，她赢得了姑母的赏识，甚至当上了大管家
During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence, that she was put in charge of the domestic staff.
哈丽特不知该用什么言辞来赞扬贝西的勤奋与高效
Aunt Harriet could not find words to priase Bessie's industriousness and efficiency.
贝西除了有各种本领以外，还是一个烹饪大师
In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook.
她担任“理想仆人”角色3年之后，哈丽特终于发现她有“小小的弱点”
She acted the role of perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her 'little' weakness.
一次，姑妈有一个星期没在“山墙庄园”住,一天下午，她出其不意地回来了，带来一大批客人，吩咐贝西准备晚饭
After being absent The Gables for a week, Aunt Harriet unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner.
结果，不仅饭菜远不如平时做得好，而且贝西走起路来似乎东倒西歪
Not only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily.
她撞到了家具上，嘴里还不断咕咕哝哝议论客人
She bumped into the furnitures and kept mumbling about the guests.
当她端着最后一道菜——一大盘布丁——走进屋来时，在地毯上绊了一跤, 布丁飞到半空，从姑母身边擦过，然后狠狠地砸在餐桌上
When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force.
这件事引起了客人们的欢笑，但哈丽特却着实吓了一跳
Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified.
她不得不认定贝西是喝醉了
She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk.
客人们自然从贝西为他们开门那一刻起就看出来了，在好长一段时间里，即最后这个乱子发生前，他们努力克制才没笑出声来
The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusement.
贝西当即被解雇了
The poor girl was dismissed instantly.
贝西走后，哈丽特姑妈发现在贝西以前用过的衣柜里整整齐齐地放着一堆堆形状各导、大小不一的酒瓶子
After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie's wardrobe.
这些酒瓶神不知鬼不觉地从酒窖来到了这里。
They had mysteriously found their way there from the wine cellar.

Lesson 50 New Year resolutions
第50课　　新年的决心

　　The New Year is a time for resolutions. 
   新年是一个下决心的时刻
Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of 'dos' and 'don'ts'. 
至少在我们大多数人心里能编列让人畏惧的做哪些和不做哪些的清单
The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. 
同样的老爱好年复一年单调的重复着
We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't' like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. 
我们决定每天早起，少吃一点，花更多的时间陪孩子玩，做很多家务，对我们不喜欢的人好一点，小心开车，每天出去遛狗
Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. 
过去的经验教会我们某些成就是无法达到的
If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. 
如果我们是最后顽固的吸烟者， 那仅仅是因为我们常常经历失败导致的挫折
Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. 
我们大多数人失败在自我改善的努力因为我们的计划太有雄心但我们从来没有时间执行他们
We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. 
我们也犯了对每一个人都宣布决定根本性的错误，以至于当我们又走回老路的时候，看起来更难堪
Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. 
意识到了这些陷阱，我今年试图让我自己知道我的决定
I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercise every morning and to read more of an evening. 
我限制自己两个不大的目标：每天早上锻炼身体，晚上多看点书
An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.
除夕夜通宵的Party让我有一个很好的借口不执行也是这年第一天新的决心，但是第二天，我更加勤奋的执行
　　The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. 
   日常锻炼只有11分钟，我计划在早上更早一点还没有人起床之前就执行
The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. 
需要比平时提早11分钟起床，自律是很难的
Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. 
然后，这两天没有人发现我之前尽力蹑手蹑脚下来进到起居室
After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. 
我跳到地毯上，把身体弯到一个难受的位置，然后精疲力尽在早餐桌边坐下
It was this that betrayed me. 
正是这个把我暴露了
The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. 
第二天早上整个家庭都列队看我表演
That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. 
那是真的令人不安，但是我回避家人的讥讽和好心的挖苦，很快每个人都习惯了
However, my enthusiasm waned. 
但是我的热情也减退了
The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. 
我花在锻炼的时间上逐渐减少
Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. 
一点一点从11分钟降到0
By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. 
到1月10号，我又回到了原点
I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work. 
我辩称，如果我少花一点时间让我精疲力尽的晨练上，当我下放回家时我将保持头脑清醒的看书
Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to book. 
抵抗电视催眠的影响，我几个晚上拿着书坐在房间里哈欠连连
One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. 
然而，有一个晚上，我感觉又冷又孤独，于是下楼，坐在电视机前假装看书
That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. 
那证是我的祸根，因为我很快回到在屏幕面前打盹的坏习惯上
I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. 
我仍然没有放弃更多阅读的决定
In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. 
事实上，我刚买了一本书标题是：一分钟内如何读一千字
Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!
或许它能解决我的问题，但是我一直没有时间看它！

第50课 新年的决心
Lesson New Year resolution

   新年是下决心的时候，
   The New Year is a time for resolutions.
至少在大多数人的心里会编排出一份“应做什么”和“不应做什么”的令人生畏的单子
Mentally, at least, most of us could compile the formidable lists of 'dos' and 'don'ts'.
相同的决心以单调的规律年复一年地出现
The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity.
我们决心每天早晨起得早些;吃得少些;多花点时间与孩子们一起做游戏;做大量的家务;对不喜欢的人友善一些;小心驾车;每天都要带着狗散步;等等
We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day.
以往的经验告诉我们有些事是办不到的
Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment.
如果我们烟瘾大，戒不掉，那是因为屡戒屡败，失去信心
If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results failure.
我们大多数人想自我完善却遭到失败，这是因为我们的规划过于宏大，而又根本没有时间去实施
Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out.
我们还犯有一个根本性的错误，即把我们的决心向大家宣布。这样一旦滑回到那些老习惯上去，我们在别人的眼里会显得更加难堪
We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways.
我深知这些问题，于是，今年我对自己的计划要严加保密，
Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself.
只给自己定下两项适中的任务;每天早上锻炼身体，每天晚上多看点书
I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening.
新年除夕举办的一次通宵晚会，使我理直气壮地在新年头一天免去了这两项任务。不过，新年第二天，我全力以赴地照着去做了
An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.
　　早锻炼一共只有11分钟，我打算在别人起床之前进行
   The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning bofore anyone had got up.
这就要求我比平时早11分钟把自己从床上拽起来，这种自我约束是很艰苦的
The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable.
不过开头两天我还是成功地蹑手蹑脚地来到楼下起居室，谁也没发现
Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out.
我在地毯上跳来蹦过去，扭曲身子，摆出各种姿势，弄得浑身不舒服，然后坐到桌边吃早饭，一副筋疲力尽的样子
After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable postions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition.
正是这副模样泄露了我的秘密
It was this that betrayed me.
第二天早晨全家人结队来到起居室看我表演
The next morning the whole faimly trooped in to watch the performance.
这真叫人不好意思，但我心平气和地顶住全家人的嘲笑和奚落。不久，大家对我习以为常了，
That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea.
而这时我的热情却减退了
However, my enthusiasm waned.
我花在锻炼上的时间逐渐减少，
The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished.
慢慢地从11分钟减到了零
Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero.
到了1月10日，我恢复了原来的作息时间
By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from.
我辩解说，早晨少耗费精力锻炼，晚上下班回家看书时头脑更清醒些
I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercise in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work.
有几天晚上，我极力摆脱了电视的诱惑，坐在自己的房间里，两眼盯在书上
Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book.
可是，有一天夜里，我感到又冷又孤单，便来到楼下坐在电视机前假装看书
One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read.
这下我可完了，因为不一会儿，我就恢复了以前的坏习惯，在屏幕前打起瞌睡来
That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen.
但我还没有放弃多看些书的决心
I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading.
事实上，我刚买来一本叫《一分钟读一千字的诀窍》的书
In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute.
也许这本书能解决我的问题，但我一直还没时间去看这本书!
Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!

相同的决心以单调的规律年复一年地出现
The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity.
我们决心每天早晨起得早些;吃得少些;多花点时间与孩子们一起做游戏;做大量的家务;对不喜欢的人友善一些;小心驾车;每天都要带着狗散步;等等
We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day.
以往的经验告诉我们有些事是办不到的
Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment.
如果我们烟瘾大，戒不掉，那是因为屡戒屡败，失去信心
If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienceed the frustration that results from failure.
我们大多数人想自我完善却遭到失败，这是因为我们的规划过于宏大，而又根本没有时间去实施
Most of us fail in efforts at self-improvements because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out.
我们还犯有一个根本性的错误，即把我们的决心向大家宣布。这样一旦滑回到那些老习惯上去，我们在别人的眼里会显得更加难堪
We also make the fundamental error of announcing my resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways.
我深知这些问题，于是，今年我对自己的计划要严加保密，
Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself.
只给自己定下两项适中的任务;每天早上锻炼身体，每天晚上多看点书
I limited myself to two modest resolutions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening.
新年除夕举办的一次通宵晚会，使我理直气壮地在新年头一天免去了这两项任务。不过，新年第二天，我全力以赴地照着去做了
An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.
　　早锻炼一共只有11分钟，我打算在别人起床之前进行
   The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up.
这就要求我比平时早11分钟把自己从床上拽起来，这种自我约束是很艰苦的
The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable.
不过开头两天我还是成功地蹑手蹑脚地来到楼下起居室，谁也没发现
Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out.
我在地毯上跳来蹦过去，扭曲身子，摆出各种姿势，弄得浑身不舒服，然后坐到桌边吃早饭，一副筋疲力尽的样子
After jumping about on the carpet and twsiting the human frame into uncomfortable positons, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausting condition.
正是这副模样泄露了我的秘密
It was this that betrayed me.
第二天早晨全家人结队来到起居室看我表演
The next morning, the whole family trooped in to watch the performance.
这真叫人不好意思，但我心平气和地顶住全家人的嘲笑和奚落。不久，大家对我习以为常了，
That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea.
而这时我的热情却减退了
However, my enthusiasm waned.
我花在锻炼上的时间逐渐减少，
The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished.
慢慢地从11分钟减到了零
Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero.
到了1月10日，我恢复了原来的作息时间
By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. 
我辩解说，早晨少耗费精力锻炼，晚上下班回家看书时头脑更清醒些
I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work.
有几天晚上，我极力摆脱了电视的诱惑，坐在自己的房间里，两眼盯在书上
Resisting the hypnotizing effect of televison, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book.
可是，有一天夜里，我感到又冷又孤单，便来到楼下坐在电视机前假装看书
One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read.
这下我可完了，因为不一会儿，我就恢复了以前的坏习惯，在屏幕前打起瞌睡来
That provied to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen.
但我还没有放弃多看些书的决心
I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading.
事实上，我刚买来一本叫《一分钟读一千字的诀窍》的书
In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute.
也许这本书能解决我的问题，但我一直还没时间去看这本书!
Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!
