The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.
打捞到的东西中最有价值的是船上的航海日志，其中有一部分仍然清晰可读
The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book, parts of which it was still possible to read.
据此，船长可以将所有的那些已经搞清的材料拼凑起来
From this the captain was able to piece together all the information that had come to light.
“卡伦”号当年在为其他船只护航驶往俄国的途中突然遭到敌方潜水艇鱼雷的袭击
The Karen had been sailing in a convoy to Russia when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine.
这一说法在“埃尔科”号返航后得到的国防部一位海军官员的证实
This was later comfirmed by a naval official at the Ministry of Defence after the Elkor had returned home.
那次打捞到的所有物品均被送往军事博物馆
All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.


第32课 一艘沉船
Lesson 32 A lost ship

打捞工作彻底失败了
The salvage operation had been a complete failure.
小船“埃尔科”号在巴伦支海搜寻了几个星期之后，正在返航途中
The small ship, Elkor, which had been searching the Barents Sea for weeks, was on its way home.
返航前，该船船长收到了大陆发来的电报，指示他们放弃这次搜寻
A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search.
船长知道日后还会再作尝试，因为他试图寻找的沉船上载有一批珍贵的金条
The captain knew that another attempt would be made later, for the sunken ship he was tring to find had been carring a precious cargo of gold bullion.

尽管船长接了电报，他还是决定再试一试
Despite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more.
他们用结实的网把海床搜索了一遍, 当一只箱子从海底被打捞上来时，甲板上人们激动不已
The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board when a chest was raised from the bottom.
船员们开始认为沉船找着了，但海底沉箱内的物品证明他们弄错了
Though the crew were at first under the impression that the lost ship had been found, the contents of the chest proved them wrong.
事实上，他们发现的是另一艘沉没多年的船。
What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before. 

木箱内装有水手艾伦.菲尔丁的私人财物，
The chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding.
其中有书箱、衣服、照片以及水手收到的妻子的来信
There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife.
“埃尔科”号船长命令船员们尽量从沉船中打捞物品，
The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to salvage as much as possible from the wreck.
但没发现什么值钱的东西，不过打捞出来的众多的物品还是引起了大家极大的兴趣
Nothing of value was found, but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest.
从捞起的一门大炮来看，船长认为那艘船一定是艘巡洋舰
From a heavy gun that was raised, the captain realized that the ship must have been a cruiser.
另一只海底沉箱中装的是船上一位军官的财物，其中有一封写于1943年3月14日的信，但没有写完
In another chest, which contained the belongings of a ship's officer, there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943.
从这封信中船长了解到沉船船名是“卡伦”号
The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.

Lesson 33 A day to remember
第33课 难忘的一天

What incident began the series of traffic accidents?
什么事件开始导致了一连串的交通事故？

We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong. 
我们都经历过一切出问题的日子
A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control. 
一天的开始可能非常美好，但是突然似乎每件事情都在失控
What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment. 
通常发生的事情是很多事情选择错误恰好都在同一时刻
It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions. 
就像一件微不足道的事情导致一连串的事情发生
Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. 
假如你正一边做饭，一边照看小孩
The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. 
电话响了，这标志着无法预料的一系列灾难的开始
While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. 
当你正在接电话，孩子在拉桌布，把你最好的瓷器餐具打碎了一半，之间还割伤了他自己
You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. 
你匆忙挂了电话来照顾小孩和瓷器等
Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. 
与此同时锅里烧焦了
As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.
让你欲哭无泪的是，你丈夫回来了，令人意外的带了三个客人一起回来吃晚餐
Things can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney. 
事情可以错误扩展到很大的范围，就像许多人最近在悉尼郊区帕拉马塔发现的那样
During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. 
一天晚上在高峰期两部车相撞，所有的司机开始争吵
The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner. 
这两部车后面的妇女正好是一位新手
She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car. 
她突然感到一阵惊慌，马上停了车
This made the driver following her brake hard. 
这样使得她后面的司机猛的追尾了
His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. 
他的妻子正拿着一个大蛋糕坐在他边上
As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road.
因为她被惯性摔向前方，这个蛋糕正好穿过挡风玻璃落在马路上 
Seeing a cake flying through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. 
看着一个蛋糕飞出来，一辆正和这辆车并行的卡车司机突然急停
The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road. 
这辆卡装满了空啤酒瓶,其中有上百个从车子后面滑落到到路上
This led to yet another angry argument. 
这也导致另一起愤怒争吵
Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. 
与此同时，后面堵的水泄不通
It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. 
这花了警察将近一个小时才让车又动起来
In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles. 
同时，货车司机不得不清扫几百个碎瓶子
Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake. 
只有两只流浪狗在这次所有混乱中受益，因为他们贪婪地吞食着留下的蛋糕
It was just one of those days!
这就事事不顺其中的一天

Lesson 34 A happy discovery
第34课 幸运的发现

What was the 'happy discovery'?
幸运的发现是什么？

Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people.
古玩店对很多人有着不同寻常的魅力
The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place. 
这类昂贵的古玩店，里面的稀世珍品陈列在漂亮的玻璃柜子里以免沾染灰尘，通常让人望而却步
But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop. 
但是没人需要鼓起勇气进入一个不那么自命不凡的古玩店
There is always hope that in its labyrinth of musty, dark, disordered rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that little the floors.
这总是希望在昏暗，乱七八糟，散发着霉味的迷宫似的房间里地板上一堆堆混乱的破烂中找到真正的稀世珍宝
No one discovers a rarity by chance. 
没有人碰巧发现一个稀世珍宝
A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience, and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it. 
一个真正专心的淘宝者必须要有耐心，最重要的是当他看到宝贝的时候要有识货的能力
To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer. 
为做到这样，他必须最少要有交易商一样的见识
Like a scientist bent on making a discovery, he must cherish the hope that one day he will be amply rewarded.
像科学家决心做一项发明，他必须对某一天他将获得足够的回报报有希望
My old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person. 
我的老朋友，哈利迪.弗兰克就是这样一个人
He has often described to me how he picked up a masterpiece for a mere $50. 
他经常对我说，他是如何只花了50美元就无意获和一幅杰作的
One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood. 
一个星期六的早上，弗兰克逛了我们小区的一家古玩店
As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to interest him. 
因为他之前没有来过那儿，他发现了一个他感兴趣的大买卖
The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor. 
一早上很快就过去了，弗兰克正要离去，突然他注意到一个大包装箱躺在地上
The dealer told him that it had just come in, but that he could not be bothered to open it. 
商人告诉他这个包才刚刚进来，但是他嫌麻烦不愿打开它
Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open.

古玩店对许多人来说有一种特殊的魅力
Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people.
高档一点的古玩店为了防尘，把文物漂亮地陈列在玻璃柜子里，那里往往令人望而却步
The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding.
而对不太装腔作势的古玩店，无论是谁都不用壮着胆子才敢往里进
But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop.
人们还常常有希望在发霉、阴暗、杂乱无章、迷宫般的店堂里，从杂乱地摆放在地面上的、一堆堆各式各样的破烂货里找到一件稀世珍品。
There is always hope that in its labyrinth of musty, dark, disordered rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that litter the floors.
无论是谁都不会一下子就发现一件珍品
No one discovers a rarity by chance.
一个到处找便宜的人必须具有耐心，而且最重要的是看到珍品时要有鉴别珍品的能力
A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience, and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it.
要做到这一点，他至少要像古董商一样懂行
To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer.
他必须像一个专心致志进行探索的科学家那样抱有这样的希望，即终有一天，他的努力会取得丰硕的成果。

Lesson 35 Justice was done
第35课 伸张正义

The word justice is usually associated with courts of law. 
正义这个词通常和法院的法律相关
We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt. 
我们也许会说，当一个人被确凿无疑证有是无辜或是有罪的时候正义被伸张了
Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law. 
正义是法律复杂的系统中的一部分
Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it. 
那些寻求正义的人们进行着一场艰苦的旅程，永远不能确信他们找到了它
Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.
法官们是人就会范错误,无论他们多么精明，多么杰出，
There are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept. 
有些罕见的例子，在那里正义几乎不再是一个抽象的概念
Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference. 
奖惩不受人为干涉
At such times, justice acts like a living force. 
在这种时候，正义像一种生命力量
When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.
当我们使用像‘他罪有应得’这样的词，我们某种程度上承认一个环境已能够自动的伸张正义
When a thief was caught on the premises of large jewellery store on morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.'
当一个小偷早上在一个大的珠宝店里被抓住的时候，这个店员肯定会情不自禁说'他罪有应得'
The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys. 
这家店是一所旧房子改装的，有很多的大，废弃的壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱
Towards midday, a girl heard a muffled cry coming from behind on of the walls. 
快中午的时候，一个女孩听到压抑的哭声从墙后传来
As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade. 
当哭声又传来几次，她跑去告诉经理，这个经理马上打了消防的救援电话
The cry had certainly come from one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was. 
哭声肯定来自某个烟囱，但是因为这里的烟囱太多了，消防员也不能确定是哪一个
They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries. 
他们通过敲击墙面听这个人的哭声定位右边的这个烟囱
After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney. 
他们凿开一堵18英寸厚的墙后，他们发现一个被困在烟囱里的男人
As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move, but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall. 
因为烟囱极其狭窄，这个男人无法动弹，但是消防员最终在墙上凿开一个巨大的洞解救了他
The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney. 
那个从烟囱出现的愁容满面，黑乎乎的身影，马上承认他在晚上试图闯进店里，但卡在烟囱里了
He had been there for nearly ten hours. 
他已经卡在这里面将近10个小时了
Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.
甚至这个人被交给警察之前正义已经得到伸张

第35课 伸张正义
Lesson 35 Justice was done

“正义”这个词常常是同法庭连在一起的
The word justice is usually associated with courts of law.
当某人被证据确凿地证明无罪的时候，我们也许会说正义得到了伸张
We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt.
正义是复杂的法律机器组成部分
Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law.
那些寻求正义的人走的是一条崎岖的道路，从来没有把握他们最终将到正义
Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it.
法官无论如何聪明与有名，毕竟也是人，也会出差错的
Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.

在个别情况下，正义不再是一种抽象概念
There are rare instances when justice alomst ceases to be an abstract concept.
奖惩的实施是不受人意志支配的
Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference.
在这种时候，正义像一种有生命的力量行使其职能
As such times, justice acts like a living force.
当我们说“他罪有应得”这句话的时候，我们部分承认了某种特定的环境使得正义自动地起了作用
When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to acts of its own accord.

一天上午，当一个小偷在一家大型珠宝店里被人抓住的时候，店员一定会忍不住说：“他罪有应得。”
When a thief was caught on the premises of a large jewellery store one morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.'
那是一座老式的、经过改造的房子，店里有许多废置不用的大壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱
The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys.
快到中午的时候，一个女售货员听见从一堵墙里传出一种闷声闷气的叫声
Towards midday, a girl heard a muffled cry coming from behind one of the walls.
由于这种喊叫声重复了几次，她跑去报告经理，经理当即给消防队挂了电话
As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade.
喊叫声肯定是从烟囱里传出来的，然而，因为烟囱太多，消防队员无法确定到底是哪一个
The cry had certainly come from one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was.
他们通过敲击烟囱倾叫声而确定传出声音的那个烟囱
They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries.
他们凿透了18英寸厚的墙壁，发现有个人卡在烟囱里
After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.
由于烟囱太窄，那人无法动弹,消防队员在墙上挖了个大洞，才终于把他解救出来
As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move, but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.
那个看来满脸沮丧、浑身漆黑的家伙从烟囱里一出来，就承认头天夜里他企图到店里行窍，但让烟囱卡住了
The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney.
他已经在烟囱里被困了将近10个小时
He had been there for nearly ten hours.
甚至在那人还没被送交给警察之前，正义就已得到了伸张
Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.

Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.

在个别情况下，正义不再是一种抽象概念
There are rare instances when justice alomst ceases to be an abstract concept.
奖惩的实施是不受人意志支配的
Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference.
在这种时候，正义像一种有生命的力量行使其职能
At such times, justice acts like a living force.
当我们说“他罪有应得”这句话的时候，我们部分承认了某种特定的环境使得正义自动地起了作用
When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.

一天上午，当一个小偷在一家大型珠宝店里被人抓住的时候，店员一定会忍不住说：“他罪有应得。”
When a thief was caught on premises of a large jewellery store one morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right'.
那是一座老式的、经过改造的房子，店里有许多废置不用的大壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱
The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys.
快到中午的时候，一个女售货员听见从一堵墙里传出一种闷声闷气的叫声
Towards midday, a girl heard a muffled cry coming from behind one of the walls.
由于这种喊叫声重复了几次，她跑去报告经理，经理当即给消防队挂了电话
As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade.
喊叫声肯定是从烟囱里传出来的，然而，因为烟囱太多，消防队员无法确定到底是哪一个
The cry had certainly come from one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was.
他们通过敲击烟囱倾叫声而确定传出声音的那个烟囱
They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries.
他们凿透了18英寸厚的墙壁，发现有个人卡在烟囱里
After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.
由于烟囱太窄，那人无法动弹,消防队员在墙上挖了个大洞，才终于把他解救出来
As it was extremely narrow, the man unable to move, the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.
那个看来满脸沮丧、浑身漆黑的家伙从烟囱里一出来，就承认头天夜里他企图到店里行窍，但让烟囱卡住了
The sorry-liking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney.
他已经在烟囱里被困了将近10个小时
He had been there for nearly ten hours.
甚至在那人还没被送交给警察之前，正义就已得到了伸张
Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.


第35课 伸张正义
Lesson 35 Justice was done

“正义”这个词常常是同法庭连在一起的
The word justice is usually associated with courts of law.
当某人被证据确凿地证明无罪的时候，我们也许会说正义得到了伸张
We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt.
正义是复杂的法律机器组成部分
Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law.
那些寻求正义的人走的是一条崎岖的道路，从来没有把握他们最终将到正义
Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it.
法官无论如何聪明与有名，毕竟也是人，也会出差错的
Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.

Lesson 36 A chance in a million
第36课 百万之一的机遇

We are less credulous than we used to be. 
比起以前我们现在不容易轻信别人
In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences -- most of them wildly improbable. 
在十九世纪，小说家通过给他的读者呈现一系列巧合使他的故事结束,他们大部份不太可能邪恶
Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother. 
读者很开心接受这些真相，一个不起眼的女仆事实上是一位英雄的母亲
A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring about the hero's downfall. And so on. 
一位失踪很久的哥哥，早就以为他死了，一直真实地活着，阴谋导致了英雄的垮台，等等诸如此类的
Modern readers would find such naive solution totally unacceptable. 
现代读者发现这种天真的方式完全无法接受
Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.
甚至，在真实生活中，环境有时共同导致了巧合，除了十九世纪的作家每个都觉不可思议
When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. 
当我还是孩的时候，我的爷爷跟我说，一个德国出租车司机，富兰芝.毕斯门如何找到一位哥哥人们以为他二十年前已经被杀了
While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. 
当他和他妻子一次徒步旅行时，他停下来和一个工人说话
After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. 
他们继续行走后，毕斯门夫人评论这个工人很像他丈夫，甚至猜想他可能是他哥哥
Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. 
富兰芝讥笑这个想法，指出他的哥在战争行动中被杀了
Though Mrs. Busssman fully acquainted with this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. 
尽管毕斯门夫人非常熟悉这个故事，但她认为这是百万分之一的机遇，她可能是对的
A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. 
几天以后，她派一个男孩去问这个工人，他是否叫汉斯.毕斯门
Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. 
不用说，这个男人的名字正是汉斯.毕斯门，他真的是富兰芝失踪很久的哥哥
When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. 
当这两兄弟重聚的时候，汉斯解释他是如何仍然活着的
After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit. 
战争快要结束之后，他被送到医院和他的部队分开
The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. 
医院被轰炸后，汉斯自己步行回到德国韦斯顿
Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. 
与此同时，他的部队不复存在，所有他的记录也被损毁
Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. 
汉斯返回他农场家里，但是房子已经被炸毁，邻居没有人知道这里的居民结果如何
Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.
汉斯以为他的家属在一次空袭中被炸死了，从此之后他留了下来定居在十五英里外的一个小村庄

Lesson 37 The Westhaven Express
第37课 开往威斯特海温的快车

We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual. 
我们期待获悉火车将准时
After years of conditioning, most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables. 
调整多年以后，我们大多数已经对列车时刻表深信不疑
Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time. 
轮船或许会因为暴风雨延误; 飞机航班可能因为糟糕天气而取消，但是火车一定会准时
Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily dislocate railway services. 
只有在极特殊暴雪情况下可能会暂时打乱铁路服务
It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. 
当事情出状况的的时候不能太轻易怪罪铁路部门
The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.
事实是当发生错误的时候，更多的是我们而不是他们

After consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. 
查阅了我的铁路时刻表之后，我高兴的注意到有一列开往威斯特海温的快车
It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted mere hour and seventeen minutes. 
它从我现在的车站始发，只需1小时17分钟
When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well. 
当我登上列车的时候，我不禁注意到很多本地人也上车了
At the time, this did not strike me as odd. 
那时，这并未让我奇怪
I reflected that there must be a great many local people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. 
我细想很多本地人除了我之外都想希望利用这些非常好的服务
Neither was I surprise when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. 
列车在几英里远一个小站威德里突然停下的时候我也没在感到吃惊
Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. 
即使一列非常快的列车几个信号灯就能让期耽搁
But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder, It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely chugging along at thirty. 
但是当列车在一站又一站浪费时间之后，我开始疑惑，我然明白了这列快车没有以90英里速度疾驰，而是勉强以30英里的速度嘟嘟前行
One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. 
一小时十七分过去了，我们甚至没有走一半的路
I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. 
我问一位乘客这是不是威斯特海温的快车，他连听都没听过
I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived. 
我决定一到就投诉他们
Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. 
两个小时后，我正愤怒的和威斯特海温车站的站长说话
When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. 
当他否认有这趟列车，我借了他一份列车时刻表
There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. 
我用胜利者的调子告诉他这里白纸黑字写着
Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. 
随意的瞥了一眼，他叫我再看看
A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. 
个很小的星号引导我看向这页的最下面页脚
It said: 'This service has been suspended.'
上面写着：“这趟列车暂停服务”

Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times. 
未的历史学家在记录我们这个时代的历史将会有独特的地位
They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates. 
他们不用知道从哪些不断累积的大量的证据中选出事实
What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word. 
而且，他们不用唯一信赖写下来的文字
Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMS are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have. 
影片，视频，唱片和光盘就是他们将拥有的大量令人眼花缭乱的信息
They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action.
他们将能够，可以说，看到和听到我们的实况
But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task. 
但是历史学家试图重构遥远的过去总是面对一些困难
He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available. 
他必须从他所能知道的极少的蛛丝马迹中推断
Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.
甚至看起来不重要的遗迹也有流露出有趣的古代人的历史
Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture, for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. 
到目前为止，历史学家已经认为历法的出现跟着农业的出现， 那时人们要面对真正有必要明白季节的事情
Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.
最近科学证据表明这个假设是不正确的

Historians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths. 
历史学家们对雕刻在墙上，骨头上，和猛犸象牙上的点，线和符号困惑了好久
The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. 
在开始于公元前3万5000年到公元前1万年的最近一个冰河期以打猎和捕鱼为生的游牧民族刻了那些标记
By correlating markings made in various parts of the world, historians have been able to read this difficult code. 
通过关联的记号构成各种各样的世界各地， 历史学已经可以认出这些困难的代码
They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon. 
他们已经发现昼夜更替和月相有关系
It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. 
它事实上是一种原始的日历
It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression. 
人们已经很早就知道被绘在墙上的狩猎场景不仅仅是一种艺术表现形式
They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing. 
他们有一个明确的意义，因为他们最接近远古人能获得和写下的东西
It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. 
那些有时伴随着图案的符号和图案和之间有一些明确的关系是很有可能的
It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.
看起来使人们真正尝试懂得季节比我们猜想的要早2万年

Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times.
对于逐渐积累起来的庞大材料，他们几乎不知道选取哪些好，
They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates.
而且，也不必完全依赖文字材料
What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word.
电影、录像、光盘和光盘驱动器只是能为他们提供令人眼花缭乱的大量信息的几种手段
Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMs are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have.
他们能够身临其境般地观看我们做事，倾听我们讲话

Lesson 39 Nothing to worry about
第39课 不必担心

The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from. 
穿过平原的道路崎岖不平，很快变的更加糟糕起来以至于我们尝试说服布鲁斯开回我们来的村庄
Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed. 
即使道路到处散乱大石块，坑坑洼洼， 布鲁斯一点也没有不安
Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away. 
瞥了一眼地图，他告诉我们下一个村庄只有20英里远
It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties. 
这并不是说布鲁斯低估困难
He simply had no sense of danger at all. 
他只是完全没有意识到危险
No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.
无论环境怎么样，他相信汽车能开的一样快

As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders. 
当我们颠簸带起一路的尘土时，我们一个急转弯避开了一块巨石
The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car. 
车轮铲起的石头不祥的击打在车子的底盘
We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine. 
我们感觉迟早有一块石头会把油箱划个洞或是损坏发动机
Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.
因此，我们一直往后看，想知道是否我们带着一样油尾巴
What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps of bushes. 
当大石块突然消失后，出了一片平原，只有几簇灌木丛，我们松了一口气
But there was worse to come. 
但是更糟糕的状况出现了
Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure. 
有一条巨大的裂缝正好在我们前面
In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped. 
我们再三恳求之下，布鲁斯停下了车
Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car. 
尽管我们所有人都下车检查这个裂缝，但他还是留在车上
We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep. 
我们告诉他这条裂缝有50码长，2英尺宽4英尺深
Even this had no effect. 
即使这样他仍没有反应
Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course. 
布鲁斯挂上低档加到可怕的速度，保持前轮跨在缝隙上，当他随着它的之字形路线进前进时
Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again. 
在我们来不及担心可能的发生的事情时，他冲出裂缝再次回到平原
Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away. 
布鲁斯再次查了下地图告诉我们下个村庄现在只有15英里远
Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across. 
我们下一个障碍是横跨半英里的浅池塘
Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt. 
布鲁斯冲向了它，但是在中途，汽车猛地停了下来
A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!
一个黄色的灯在仪表盘上猛闪，布鲁斯愉快的宣布发动机没油了！

尽管路面布满石头，坑坑洼洼，但布鲁斯却一点儿不慌乱
Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed.
他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们前面再走不到20英里就是一个村庄
Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away.
这并不是说布鲁斯总是低估困难，

Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course.
我们还未来得及担心后果，车已重新开上了平地
Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again.
布鲁斯又看了一眼地图，告诉我们那座村庄离我们只有15英里了
Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away.
下一个障碍是一片约半英里宽的浅水塘

他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们前面再走不到20英里就是一个村庄
Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away.
这并不是说布鲁斯总是低估困难，
It was not that Bruce always underestimated diffculties.
而是他压根儿没有一点儿危险感
He simply had no sense of danger at all.
他认为不管路面情况如何，车必须以最高速度前进
No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.
我们在尘士飞扬的道路上颠簸，车子东拐西弯，以躲开那些大圆石
As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders.
车轮搅起的石块锤击车身，发出不祥的锤击声
The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car.
我们想迟早会飞起一个石块把油箱砸开一个窟窿，或者把发动机砸坏
We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine.
因此，我们不时地掉过头，怀疑车后是否留下了机油和汽油的痕迹
Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.

突然大石块不见了，前面是一片平地，唯一的障碍只有一簇簇灌木丛。这使我们长长地松了口气
What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps of bushes.
但是更糟糕的事情在等着我们，
But there was worse to come
离我们不远处，出现一个大裂缝
Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure.
我们再次央求布鲁斯小心，他这才把车停了下来
In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped.
我们纷纷下车察看那个大裂缝，他却呆在车上
Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car.
我们告诉他那个大裂缝长50码，宽2英尺，深4英尺
We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep.
这也没有对他产生任何影响
Even this had no effect.
布鲁斯挂上慢档，把两只前轮分别搁在裂缝的两边，顺着弯弯曲曲的裂缝，以发疯的速度向前开去
Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front the wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course.
我们还未来得及担心后果，车已重新开上了平地
Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again.
布鲁斯又看了一眼地图，告诉我们那座村庄离我们只有15英里了
Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away.
下一个障碍是一片约半英里宽的浅水塘
Our next obstacle was a shollow pool of water about half a mile across.
布鲁斯向水塘冲去，但车开到水塘当中，嘎吱一声停住了
Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt.
仪表盘一盏黄灯闪着刺眼的光芒，布鲁斯兴致勃勃地宣布发动机里没油了!
A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!



第39课 不必担心
Lesson 39 Nothing to worry about

穿越平原的道路高低不平，开车走了不远，路面愈加崎岖，我们想劝说布鲁斯把车开回我们出发的那个村庄去
The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from.
尽管路面布满石头，坑坑洼洼，但布鲁斯却一点儿不慌乱
Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed.
