确切数字

编辑对事实和统计数据的坚持有什么后果？

报刊杂志的编辑常常为了向读者提供成立一些无关紧要的事实和统计数字而走向极端。去
年， 一位记者受一家有名的杂志的委托写一篇关于非洲某个新成立共和国总统府的文章。 稿
子寄来后，编辑看第一句话就拒绝予以发表。文章的开头是这样的： “几百级台阶通向环绕
总统的高墙。 ”编辑立即给那位记者发去传真，要求他核实一下台阶的确切数字和围墙的高

编辑等得不耐烦了，因为杂志马上要付印。他给记者先后发去两份传真，但对方毫无反应。
于是他又发了一份传真，通知那位记者说，若再不迅速答复，将被解雇。但记者还是没有回

不仅被捕了，而且还被送进了监狱。不过，他终于获准发回了一份传真。在传真中他告诉编
辑，就在他数通向 15 英尺高的总统府围墙的 1， 084 级台阶时，被抓了起来。

                    The facts
What was the consequence of the editor's insistence on facts and statistics?
    Editors of newpapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with umimportant facts and
statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began:'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace.' The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.
    The journalist immedately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them.
Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.

## Summary writing

    Though the journalist immediately set out to get the facts after receiving instructions from his editor,
he did not send them at once. Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, so he sent three faxes, finally threatening to fire the journalist. When the last fax was unanswered, the article was published in its original form. The journalist sent the editor a fax a week later explaining he had been imprisoned after counting the steps and measuring the height of the wall.

## Vocabulary

journalist  --> reporter  
instructed  --> ordered, commissioned  
well-known  --> famous  
publish --> print, issue  
surrounds   --> encircles  
fired   --> sacked, dismissed  
reluctantly --> unwillingly

## Composition

    The journalist counted the number of steps as he wearily climbed up to the high wall surrounding the presdent's palace.
On arrving at the main gate, he sat down to get his breath back. He then produced a tape measure in order to measure the wall. While he was busy measureing the wall, a policeman approached him and asked him what he was doing.
Though the journalist explained he was a reporter and his editor had asked him to find out the exact height of the wall, the policeman refused to believe him. He was arrested and sent to prison because the police thought that he might be a spy or might even want to assassinate the president. When the journalist insisted he was innocent, he made things worse of himself. This proved to the police that the man certainly was guilty and deserved to stay in prison indefinitely.

泰勒先生怎么尝试抓住那些窃贼?

皮卡迪利大街附近的一条著名拱廊街道上，几家高档商店刚刚开始营业。在早晨的这个时候，
拱廊街上几乎空无一人。珠宝店主泰勒先生正在欣赏新布置的橱窗。他手下两名店员从早上 8 点就
开始忙碌，这时刚刚布置完毕。钻石项链、戒指漂亮地陈列在黑色丝绒上面。泰勒先生站在橱窗外
凝神欣赏了几分钟就回到了店里。
宁静突然被打破，一辆大轿车亮着前灯，响着喇叭，呼啸着冲进了拱廊街，在珠宝店门口停了
下来。一人留在驾驶座上，另外两个用黑色长筒丝袜蒙面的人跳下车来。他们用铁棒把商店橱窗的
玻璃砸碎。这开始发生时，泰勒先生正在楼上。他与店员动手向窗外投掷家具，椅子，桌子飞落
在拱廊街上。一个窃贼被一尊很重的雕像击中，但由于他忙着抢钻石首饰，竟连疼痛都顾不上
了。这场抢劫只持续了 3 分钟，因为窃贼争先恐后地爬上轿车，以惊人的速度开跑了。就在轿车离
开的时候，泰勒先生从店里冲了出来，跟在车后追赶，一边还往车上扔烟灰缸、花瓶。但他已无法
抓住那些窃贼了。他们已带着价值数千镑的首饰逃之夭夭了

How did Mr. Taylor try to stop the thieves?
    The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. 
At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylar, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylar went back into his shop.
    The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn
blaring, roared down the arcade. it came to a stop outside the jewellery's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stocking over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.

第八课　著名的修道院
Lesson 8 A famous monastery

圣伯纳德犬是用来做什么的?
What are the St. Bernard dogs used for?

圣伯纳德大山口连接着瑞士与意大利，海拔 2,473O 米，是欧洲最高的山口。
The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2,437 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe.
11 世纪建造的著名的圣伯纳德修道院位于离山口 1 英里远的地方。
The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away.
几百年来， 圣伯纳德修道院驯养狗拯救了许多翻越这道山口的旅游者的生命。
For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous pass.
那些最先从亚洲引进的狗，待人友好，早在罗马时代就给人当看门狗了。
These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times.
如今由于山里开挖了隧道，翻越山口已不那么危险了。
Now that a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous,
但每年还要派狗到雪山地里去帮助那些遇到困难的旅游者，
but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty.
尽管修通了隧道，但仍有一些人想冒险徒步跨越圣伯纳德山口。
Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.
夏天的几个月里，修道院十分忙碌，因为有成千上万的人驾车通过山口，顺道来修道院参观。
During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars.
由于来人太多，狗被关在专门的围栏里。
As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.
然而到了冬天，修道院里的生活则是另一番景象。
In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different.
气温下降到零下 30 度，试图跨越山口的人寥寥无几。
The temperature drops to -30 and very few people attempt to cross the Pass.
修道士们喜欢冬天，而不太喜欢夏天。因为在冬天，他们可以更多地过无人打扰的生活。
The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy.
狗也比较自由，被放出围栏，四处遛达。
The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure.
冬天常来修道院参观的只有一批批滑雪者。他们在圣诞节或复活节到那儿去。
The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter.
这些热爱高山清静环境的年轻人每年都受到圣伯纳德道院的热烈欢迎。
These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.

猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。
Cats never fail to fascinate human beings.
它们可以对人友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。
They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans,but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well.
它们从不像狗和马一样变得那么顺从。
They never become submissive like dogs and horses.
结果是人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。
As a result,humans have learned to respect feline independence.
在它们的一生中， 大多数猫都对人存有戒心。
Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives.
最使我们感兴趣的一件事情就是一种通俗的信念——猫有九条命。
One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives.
显然，这种说法里面包含着许多真实性。
Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea.
猫在跌落时能够大难不死是有事实作为依据的。
A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.
最近，纽约动物医疗中心对 132 只猫进行了为期 5 个月的综合研究。
Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months.
所有这些猫有一个共同的经历： 它们都曾从高层建筑上摔下来过， 但只有其中的 8 只猫死于震荡或跌伤。
All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries.
当然，纽约是进行这种有趣的试验的一个理想的地方，因为那里根本不缺乏高楼大厦，
Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings.
有的是高层的窗槛从上往下坠落。
There are plenty of high-rise windowsill to fall from!
有一只叫萨伯瑞的猫从 32 层楼上掉下来， 但只摔断一颗牙。
One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth.
“猫就像训练有素的跳伞队员， ” 一位医生说。
'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers,' a doctor said.
看起来，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。
It seems that the further cats fall, the less are likely to injure themselves.
在一个长长的跌落过程中，它们可以达到每小时 60 里甚至更快的速度。
In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more.
在高速下落中，猫有时间放松自己。
At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax.
它们伸展四肢，就像飞行中的松鼠一样。
They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels.
这样就加大了空气阻力，并减少了它们着地时冲击力带来的震动。
This increases their air-reinstance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.

第10课 “泰坦尼克 ”号的沉没
Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic

如果16个密封舱中只有两个被水淹没了，会发生什么?
What would have happened if only two of sisteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?

巨轮 “泰坦尼克 ”号 1912 年 4 月 10 日从南安普敦起锚驶向纽约。
The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912.
船上载有 1,316 名乘客与 891 名船员。
She was carring 1,316 passengers and a crew of 891.
即便用现代标准来衡量， 45,000 吨的 “泰坦尼克 ”号与算得上一艘巨轮了。
Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship.
当时，这艘轮船不仅是造船史上建造的最大的一艘船，而且也被认为是不会沉没的。
At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable,
因为船由 16 个密封舱组成，
for she had sixteen watetight compartments.
即使有两个舱进水，仍可漂浮的水面上。
Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float.
然而，这艘巨轮首航就下沉，造成大批人员死亡。人们将永远记着这艘巨轮的沉没惨剧。
The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.
“泰坦尼克 ”起航后的第 4 天，它正行驶在北大西洋冰冷的海面上。突然，了望员发现一座冰山。
Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout.
 警报响过不久， 巨轮急转弯， 以避免与冰山正面相撞。
 After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision.
“泰坦尼克 ”这个弯拐得及时，紧贴着高出海面 100 英尺的巨大的冰墙擦过去。
The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her.
突然，从船舱下部传来一声微颤音，船长走下船舱去查看究竟。
Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened.
由于这个声音非常轻，没人会想到船身已遭损坏。
The noise had been to so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged.
在下面，船长惊恐的地发现 “泰坦尼克 ”号正在急速下沉， 16 个密封舱已有 5 个进水。
Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sisteen watertight compartments had already been flooded!
于是，他发出弃船的命令，几百人跳进了冰冷刺骨的海水里。
The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water.
由于没有足够的救生艇运载所有乘客，结果， 1,500人丧生
As there were not enought lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.

然而，这艘巨轮首航就下沉，造成大批人员死亡。人们将永远记着这艘巨轮的沉没惨剧。
The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.
“泰坦尼克 ”起航后的第 4 天，它正行驶在北大西洋冰冷的海面上。突然，了望员发现一座冰山。
Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout.
 警报响过不久， 巨轮急转弯， 以避免与冰山正面相撞
 After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision.
“泰坦尼克 ”这个弯拐得及时，紧贴着高出海面 100 英尺的巨大的冰墙擦过去。
The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her.
突然，从船舱下部传来一声微颤音，船长走下船舱去查看究竟。
Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened.
由于这个声音非常轻，没人会想到船身已遭损坏。
The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged.
在下面，船长惊恐的地发现 “泰坦尼克 ”号正在急速下沉， 16 个密封舱已有 5 个进水。
Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded.
于是，他发出弃船的命令，几百人跳进了冰冷刺骨的海水里。
The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water.
由于没有足够的救生艇运载所有乘客，结果， 1,500人丧生
As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.

第10课 “泰坦尼克 ”号的沉没
Lesson 10 The loss of Titanic

如果16个密封舱中只有两个被水淹没了，会发生什么?
What would have happened if only two of sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?

巨轮 “泰坦尼克 ”号 1912 年 4 月 10 日从南安普敦起锚驶向纽约。
The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912.
船上载有 1,316 名乘客与 891 名船员。
She was carring 1,316 passengers and a crew of 891.
即便用现代标准来衡量， 46,000 吨的 “泰坦尼克 ”号也算得上一艘巨轮了。
Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship.
当时，这艘轮船不仅是造船史上建造的最大的一艘船，而且也被认为是不会沉没的。
At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable,
因为船由 16 个密封舱组成，
for she had sixteen watertight comppartments.
即使有两个舱进水，仍可漂浮的水面上。
Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float!

第11课 无罪  Lesson 11 Not guilty

海关在找什么？
What was the Customs Officer looking for?

现在的海关官员往往相当宽容, 但是，当你通过绿色通道，没有任何东西需要申报时，他们仍可以拦住你。
Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare.
甚至是最诚实的人也常弄得觉得有罪似的，
Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty.
而老练的职业走私犯却使手提箱里藏着 500 只金表，却也处之泰然。
The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase.
最近一次，我也出国归来，碰上一位特别好管闲事的年轻海关官员，他显然把我当成走私犯。
When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officous young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.
“您有什么需要申报的吗？ ” 他直盯着我的眼睛问。
'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.
“没有。 ” 我自信地回答说。
'No,' I answered confidently.
“请打开这只手提箱好吗？ ”
'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?'
“好的。 ” 我回答说。
'Not at all,' I answered
那位官员十分仔细地把箱子检查了一遍。
The Officer went through the case with great care.
所有细心包装好的东西一会儿工夫就乱成一团。
All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess.
我相信那箱子再也关不上了。
I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again.
突然，我看到官员脸上露出了得意的神色。
Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up.
他在我的箱底发现了一只小瓶， 高兴地一把抓了起来。
He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.
“香水，嗯？ ” 他讥讽地说道， “你刚才应该申报，香水要上进口税的。 ”
'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'
“不， 这不是香水， ”我说， “是发胶。 ” 
'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.'
接着我脸带微笑补充说： “这是一种我自己配制的奇特的混合物。 ”
Then I added with a smile,'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'
果然不出所料，他并不相信我
As I expected, he did not believe me.
“你就闻一闻吧！ ”我催促说。
'Try it!' I said encouragingly.
海关官员拧开瓶盖，把瓶子放到鼻子底下。
The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils.
一股怪味袭来，使他相信了我说的真话。
He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth.
几分钟后，我终于被放行，手提划着宝贵的粉笔记号的行李，匆匆离去。
A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.

第12课 荒岛生活 Life on a desert island

这两个人在荒岛上逗留有什么特别之处？
What was exceptional about the two men's stay on the desert island?

我们许多人对于荒岛生活有一种不切实际的想法。
Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island.
我们有时想象荒岛是阳光终日普照的天堂。
We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines.
在那里， 生活简单又美好。
Life there is simple and good.
成熟的水果从树上掉下来，人们根本无需劳动。
Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work.
另一种想法恰恰相反，
The other side of the picture is quite the opposite.
认为荒岛生活很可怕，
Life on a desert island is wretched.
要么饿死，要么像鲁滨孙那样，天天盼船来，却总没见船影。
You either starve to death or live like Robbinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes.
也许，这两种想像都有可信之处。但很少有人能有机会去弄个究竟。
Perhaps there is an element of truth is both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.
最近有两个人在一座珊瑚岛上呆了 5 天，他们真希望在那儿再多呆一些日子。
Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer.
他们驾着一条严重损坏的小船从维尔京群岛去迈阿密修理。
There were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Island to Miami to have it repaired.
途中，船开始下沉，
During the journey, their boat began to sink.
他们迅速把食物、火柴、罐装啤酒往一只救生筏上装。然后在加勒比海上划行了几英里，到了一座珊瑚岛上。
They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island.
岛上几乎没有一颗树，也没有淡水，但这不算什么问题。
There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem.
他们用像皮艇蓄积雨水。
The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy.
由于他们随身带了一支捕鱼枪，因此，吃饭不愁。
As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat.
他们天天捕捉龙虾和鱼，正如其中一位所说，吃得 “像国王一样好 ” 。
They caught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it 'ate like kings'.
5 天后，一条油轮从那儿路过，搭救了他们。这二位不得不离开那个荒岛时，还真的感到遗憾呢！
When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.

There was a time when the owners of shops and buisnesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection'.
如果交款不及时 ,歹徒们就会很快捣毁他的商店 ,让他破产
If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destorying his shop.
榨取 " 保护金 " 并不是一种现代的罪恶行径 .
Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime.
早在 14 世纪 ,英国人约翰 .霍克伍德就有过非凡的发现 :" 人们情愿拿出大笔的钱 ,也不愿毕生的心血毁于歹徒之手 .
As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.
600 年前 ,约翰 . 霍克伍德爵士带着一队士兵来到意大利 ,在佛罗伦萨附近驻扎下来 ,
Six hundred years ago, Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence.
很快就出了名 .意大利人叫他乔凡尼 .阿库托 .
He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.
每次意大利各城邦之间打伏 , 霍克伍德把他的士兵雇佣给愿给他出高价的君主。
Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the hight price he demanded.
和平时期, 当生意萧条时 ,霍克伍德便带领士兵进入某个城邦 ,纵火烧毁一两个农场 ,然后提出 ,如向他们缴纳保护金 ,他们便主动撤离。
In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.
霍克伍德用这种方法挣了大笔钱.
Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way.
尽管如此 , 意大利人还是把他视作某种英雄。
In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.
他 80 岁那年死去时 ,佛罗伦萨人为他举行了国葬 , 并为他画像以纪念这位 " 骁勇无比的战士、杰出的领袖乔凡尼 .阿库托先生 ."
When he died at the age of eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a picture painted which was dedicated to the memory to 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue.

英译中

孩子们总是喜欢得到一些小钱．　当然是爸爸妈提供了平常的零用钱，但是舅舅阿姨们总收入的额外来源．
对于孩子们来讲，小钱可以积攒很久．　如果50便士没有拿去换糖果，他们可以在钱罐里叮当响上几个月．
只有非常节俭的孩子能够装满钱罐．因为对于大部分孩子讲50便士买到一块又好又大的巧克力是很小的代价．
我的外甥，乔治，有一个总是空着的钱罐．几乎没有50便士和一英镑的硬币，这些我之前都有给他放进他的钱罐．
昨天我给了他50便士并建议他存起来．反而50便士给他带来了麻烦．在去糖果店的路上，他把50便士掉了，它沿着人行道弹跳着，然后消失在一个下水道．　乔治脱掉夹克，卷起袖子，按着他的手臂伸进下水道．
他在所有地方都没能找到50便士，更有甚者，他手臂拔不出来了．
一群人围在他身边，一位女士用肥皂和黄油擦他的手臂，但乔治还是牢牢被卡住．
呼叫消防队后两名消队战士用一种特别的润滑油解救了乔治．
乔治的经历没有使他太难过，因为这位女士，她是糖果店的老板听说他的麻烦后用一大盒巧克力补偿了他．

第15课 五十便士的麻烦  Fifty pence worth of trouble

Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?

孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。
Children always appreciate small gifts of money.
爸爸妈妈当然经常给孩子零花钱，但是，叔舅婶姨也是孩子们额外收入来源。
Mum and dad, of course, provide a regular supply of pocket money, but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.
对于有些孩子来说，少量的钱可以花很长一段时间。
With some children, small sums go a long way.
如果 50 便士不拿来换糖吃，则可以放在储蓄罐里叮当响上好几月。
If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, they rattle for months inside money boxes.
但是能把储蓄罐装满的只有屈指可数的几个特别节俭的孩子。
Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.
对大部分孩子来说， 用 50 便士来买一大块好的巧克力，是算不了什么的。
For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.
我的外甥乔治有一个储蓄罐，但总是空空的。
My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.
我给了不少 50 便士的硬币，但没有几个存到储蓄罐里。
Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.
昨天，我给了他 50 便士让存起来，
I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.
却拿这钱给自己买了 50 便士的麻烦。
Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.
在他去糖果店的路上， 50 便士掉在地上，在人行道上跳了几下，掉进了阴沟里。
On his way to the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.
乔治脱掉外套，卷起袖子，将右胳膊伸进了阴沟盖。
George took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.
但他摸了半天也没找到那 50 便士硬币，他的胳膊反倒退不出来了。
He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.
这时在他周围上了许多人， 一位女士在乔治胳膊上抹了肥皂，黄油，但乔治的胳膊仍然卡得紧紧的。
A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,but George was firmly stuck.
有人打电话叫来消防队，两位消防队员使用了一种特殊的润滑剂才使乔治得以解脱。
The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using a special type of grease.
不过，此事并没使乔治过于伤心，因为糖果店老板娘听说了他遇到的麻烦后，赏给他一大盒巧克力。

第17课　世界上最长的吊桥

英译中
Lesson17 The longest suspension bridge in the world

How is the bridge supported?
桥是如何支撑的？

Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known, sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.
维拉萨诺，一位鲜为人知的意大利人，在１524年驶进纽约港，并把它命名为安古拉姆
He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river'.
他描绘这里是非常宜人的地方，位于两座小山之间，一条大河滔滔奔流
Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal, for on November 21st, 1964, the greatest suspension bridge in the world was named　after him.
尽管维拉萨诺绝对算不上一个伟大的探险家，但他仍可能流芳百世，因为在1964年11月21日，世界最大的桥用他的名字命名
The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a span of 4260 feet.
维拉萨诺大桥由奥斯马·安曼设计，连接布鲁克林和斯塔顿岛，它的跨度有4260英尺
The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer.
大桥太长了，设计师不得不考虑拱形设计
Two great towers support four huge cables.
两座巨大的桥塔拉着４条巨大的钢索
The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.
桥塔建在一个水下巨大的钢筋混泥土平台上
The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.
平台延伸到海水下超过100英尺深
These alone took sixteen months to build.
这些独一无二的桥塔花了16个月建造
Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.
桥塔出水面的部份将近有700英尺高
They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.
他们支撑着悬挂着桥梁的钢索
Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire.
4条钢索中的每一条都包含26.108根钢丝
It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity.
据估算如果大桥上塞满汽车的话，它总的承重量只有它自己的３倍
However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.
然而，最重要的事情不仅只有尺寸和强度
Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.
尽管它很巨大，它即简单又优美别致，它的设计师的梦是要创造"一幅尽可能精细的巨型绘画"令人满意

In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.
灯泡一刻不停地闪烁着，就像失去了控制的红绿灯
These lights flickered continuously like trafiic lights which have gone mad.
小黑盒子里迸出火花，红色灯泡发怒似地忽明忽暗
Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily.
这儿倒像是在展览古老的电子设备
It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment
好像设计这些奇形怪状的展品不仅是为了给人感情上的强烈刺激，而且还想给人以电击似的！
These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them electric shocks as well.
