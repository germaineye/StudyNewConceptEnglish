# Lesson 2 Thirteen equals one

十三等于一
教区的牧师听到钟声高兴吗？为什么？
我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事筹集资金。但始终未能筹足资金把教堂的钟修好。
教堂的钟很大，以前不分昼夜打点报时，但很多年前遭到毁坏，从此便无声无息了。
一天夜里，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了，大钟又在 “打点 ”报时了！他一看表，才 1 点钟，
可是那钟一边敲了 13 下才停。牧师拿着一支电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟发生了什么事情。
借着电筒光。他看见一个人，马上认出那是本地杂货店主经比尔 . 威尔金斯。
“你究竟在这上面干什么，比尔？ ”牧师惊讶地问。
“我想把这口钟修好， ”比尔回答说。 “好几个星期了，我天天夜里到钟楼上来。嗯，我
是想让你大吃一惊。 ”
“你确实使我大吃了一惊！ ”牧师说， “也许同时你把村里所有的人都吵醒了。不过，钟
又能报时了，我还是很高兴的。 ”
“问题就在这里，牧师， ”比尔回答说。 “不错，钟能报时了，但是，恐怕每到 1 点钟，
它总要敲 13 下，对此我已无能为力了。 ”
“大家慢慢就习惯了， 比尔， ”牧师说。 “ 13下是不如 1 下好， 但总比 1 下也不敲强。 来，
咱们下楼去喝杯茶吧。“

Thirteen equals one
Was the vicar pleased that the clock striking? Why?
Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since. One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer. 'Whatever are you doing? up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise. 'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.' 'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is woking again.' 'That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's woking all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.' 'We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar, 'Thirteen is not as good as one,but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

    1） 三元素： A.高频副词 always B.一件令人讨厌的事情 C.动词采用进行式  
    2） 三元素中前两个元素 A、 B 不可或缺：

        原文例句： But he has never managed to get enough money to have the church  
        clock repaired. 但是始终没能筹足钱把教堂的钟修修好。  
    2） 含义重点 1： 做事的人不是主语。  
        例句： He has his work done. 他叫人替他把工作搞定了。  
        She has her house painted. 她叫人把屋子粉刷了一遍。  
    3） 含义重点 2: 真正干活的人， 不露脸， 信息缺失。

        They have their robes washed and ironed. 连魔法袍都有人帮他们洗好熨烫好  
3. 强调手段的“霸气  
    1） 强调手段 1： 明明可以省略的， 就是不省略
        原文例句：In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.  
        借着手电筒的光线， 他看见一个人， 立马认出那是本地杂货铺的老板 Bill Wilkins。  
        whom 的“刻意不省略”＝强调  
        扩展例句：Tom finally met the old lady whom he had been helping financially over the years.  
    2） 强调手段 2： wh-词加上-ever 后缀， 构成“强调疑问词”  
        课文原句： ‘Whatever are you doing up here Bill?’ asked the vicar in surprise.  
        “你究竟在这上面干什么， Bill?” 牧师惊讶地问。  
        扩展例词&例句： whoever, whenever, wherever, however  
        Whoever could have done such a thing? 究竟谁能干出这种事儿？  
        Whenever will he come? 他究竟什么时候才来呢？  
        Wherever have you been? 你到底去哪里了？  
        However did you escape? 你究竟是怎么逃出来的？  
        口语中, 可以使用 What + on earth 替代 Whatever, Who + on earth 替代 Whoever

        Where on earth have you been?  
        How on earth did you escape?  
    3） 强调手段 3： 借助特殊词汇  
        a. 课文原句：‘You certainly did gave me a surprise!’said the vicar. “你确实让我大吃一惊！ ”牧师说。  
        b. 句子的能量要求：
            陈述句所需要的能量最低， 疑问句（因为需要改变句序） 和否定句（因为需要带领 not 出镜） 的能量要求比较高， 因此， 疑问句和否定与需要引入“能量词”： 助动词 do, does, did。  
        c. 助动词的能量功能： 助动词们为全句能量助力。 一般使用在能量消耗大的疑问句和否定句中； 如果出现在低耗能的陈述句中， 助动词就变成了“额外能量”， 起到了强调语气的功能。  
        I know him. 我了解他。  -->> I certainly do know him. 我自是天底下最了解他的。  
        I love him. 我爱他。  -->>     I certainly do love him.  我爱他爱得死去活来。 这是如此不争的事实。 全世界的洪荒之力都挡不住我
        对他的感情的  
4. 分词学来干什么用？  
    1） 去构成语法；  
    2） 去当形容词；  
    3） 去当副词。  
5. 分词来当形容词： 定语从句当修饰成分 VS 分词当修饰成分  
    a rabbit that talks 一只会说话的兔子= a talking rabbit  
    a dog that is barking 一只正在叫唤的狗 ＝ a barking dog  
    eyes that are sunken 深陷的双眼 = sunken eyes  
    a beach that is kissed by sun 洒满阳光的海滩 = a sun-kissed beach  
6. 语言学中的经济原则： 能用一个字表达， 就不用两个。  
7. 分词来当副词成分  
    课文中原句：  
    Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o’clock. 他一看表， 才 1 点钟。
    Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.  
    牧师拿着一支手电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟发生了什么事情。  
    1） 比较： “如果使用状语从句来当副词成分”  
    When he looked at his watch, he saw that it was one’s clock.  
    After he was armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.  
    2） 从状语从句—>分词作状语的瘦身方式： 3 步曲
        a. 砍掉连接词；
        b. 砍掉主语;
        c. 谓语动词如果是主动语态， 一律改成 doing, 如果是被动语态， 则砍掉 be 动词， 保留 done.  
8. 随堂练  
    1. The troll was advancing on her when it knocked the sinks off the walls.  
        The troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls.
    2. As it howled with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club.

We were used to hearing our church bell striking the hours in our small village. For as long as anyone could remember, the bell had struck the hours day and night. However, one night the church bell remained silent and the next morning we saw that the clock had stopped at exactly one a.m. Our clock was clearly demaged, but no one could explain how this had happened.
Armed with a torch, our vicar climbed into the church tower to see what was going on. He heard a loud buzz as he went towards the clock and in the torchlight he found it had been ivaded by bees. He was luky they didn't sting him! He shone his torch into the great beel and saw that it was full of wax and honey. No wonder it wasn't working!
A bee keeper was called in to deal with the situation. He immediately removed the queen bee to one of his bee hives and the other bees followed. The clock was cleaned and was soon working again. We not only enjoyed hearing it strike the hours day and night, but we enjoyed eating the honey as well.
