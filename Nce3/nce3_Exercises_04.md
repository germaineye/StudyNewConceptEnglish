阿尔弗雷德.布洛格斯的双重生活
阿尔弗为什么想要一份白领的工作？
如今， 从事体力劳动的人的收入一般要比坐办公室的人高出许多。 坐办公室的之所以常
常被称作 “白领工人 ”，就是因为他们通常是穿着硬领白衬衫，系着领带去上班。许多人常常
情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的殊荣， 此乃人之常情。 而这常常会引起种种奇怪的
现象，在埃尔斯米尔公司当清洁工的艾尔弗雷德 .布洛斯就是一个例子。
艾尔弗结婚时，感到非常难为情，而没有将自己的职业告诉妻子。他只说在埃尔斯米尔
公司上班。每天早晨，他穿上一身漂亮的黑色西装离家上班，然后换上工作服，当 8 个小时
清洁工。 晚上回家前， 他洗个淋浴， 重新换上那身黑色西服。 两年多以来， 艾尔弗一直这样，
他的同事也为他保守秘密。 艾尔弗的妻子一直不知道她嫁给了一个清洁工， 而且她永远也不
会知道了，因为艾尔弗已找到薪职，不久就要坐办公室里工作了。他将来挣的钱只有他现在
的一半。不过他觉得，地位升高了，损失点儿钱也值得。从此，艾尔弗可以一天到晚穿西服
了。别人将称呼他为 “布洛格斯先生 ”，而不再叫他 “艾尔弗 ”了。

    The double life of Alfred Bloggs
Why did Alf want a white-collar job?
These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who wark in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who  worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simple told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret. Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon he working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.

## Composition

Nearly caught
One morning, Alf left home dressed in a smart black suit and then changed into overalls and was going to spend the day as a dustman as usually. Today Alf and three other dustmen were assigned to dust a house of Mrs. Frost who is a Alf's wife's friend. Alf and three other dustmen were collecting rubbish by dustcart. When they had just arrived at Mrs. Frost' house, Alf's wife was visiting Mrs. Frost.  As soon as Alf was just getting out of the dustcart, he saw his wife leaving Mrs. Frost's house. Alf was very surprised and immediately hid in dustcart. The dustmen helped him when his wife talked to Mrs. Frost on the doorstep. After a while the dustart drove away just as Mrs. Bloggs came towards it.

One morning Alf and three other dustmen were collecting rubbish in Merton Street and they stopped outside Mrs. Frost's house.
Though Alf didn't know it, his wife was visiting Mrs. Frost at the time. She and Mrs. Frost wre old friends, though Mrs. Frost had never met Alf. Alf was just getting out of the dustcart to go into Mrs. Frost's backyard, when he saw his wife leaving Mrs. Frost's house. He quickly returned to the dustcart and hid in the driving cabin. While he was hiding, his fellow dustmen helped him by collecting Mrs. Frost's rubbish. Meanwhile, Alf's wife and Mrs. Frost talked on the doorstep. It looked as though their conversation would never end!
At last Mrs. Bloggs said goodbye to Mrs. Frost. She waved to one of the dustmen whom she recognized and she went towards the dustcart to greet him. The dustman waved back and gave her a big smile as the dustcart drove off. Mrs. Bloggs stood on the pavement and watched the dustcart disappear down the street. Then she began to walk home. 'It's all right, Alf' his friend said,'She can't see you now.' 'Thanks, Jim' Alf said, 'That was a lucky escape!'

## Letter writing

Dear Mrs. Frost,

    I look forward to hearing from you soon.
                    Yours sincerely.
