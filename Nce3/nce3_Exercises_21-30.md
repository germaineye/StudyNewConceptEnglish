狱卒热切地观察着，急于想了解他的同事是否记熟了台词
The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.
贵族盯着纸看了几秒钟，
The noble stared on the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.
然后，眼珠一转，说道：“光线太暗，请给我读一下这封信”
Then, squinting his eyes, he said,'The light is dim. Read the letter to me.'
说完，他一下子把信递给狱卒
And he promptly hand to the gaoler.
狱卒发现自己连一个字也记不住，于是便说：“陛下，这儿光线的确太暗了，我得去眼镜拿来”
Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either, the gaoler replied:'The light is indeed dim, sire, I must get my glasses.'
他一边说着，一边匆匆下台
With this, he hurried off the stage.
贵族感到非常好笑的是：一会儿工夫，狱卒重新登台，拿来一副眼镜以及平时使用的那封信，然后为那囚犯念了起来
Much to the aristocrat's amusement, the gaoler returned a few moments later with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he preceeded to read to the prisoner.

Lesson A skeleton in the cupboard

在小说中， 我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家庭，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密
We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which have been concealed from strangers for years.
英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况
The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.
惊人的秘密称作“柜中骷髅 ”
The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard.
在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地
At some dramatic moment, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.
当读者到小说最后几页了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5 个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。
The reader's hair stood on end when he read in the final pages of the novel that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.
这种事发生在小说中是无可非议的
It is very well such things to occur in fiction.
尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密,连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道，但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅
To varying degrees, we all have secrets which we do not want even the cloest friends to learn, buf few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.
我所认识的唯一的在柜中藏骷嵝的人便是乔治.卡尔顿， 他甚至引以为自豪
The only person I know who have a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact.
乔治年轻时学过医，
George studied medicine in his youth.
然而， 他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家
Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective story.
有一次， 我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记
I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget in his house.
乔治把我领进客房，说这间很少使用
George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, rarely was used.
他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭
He told me to unpack my things and come downstairs to dinner.
我将衬衫、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把随身带来的两套西服中的一套挂到大衣柜里去
After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers, I decided to hang one of the two suits that I had brought with me in the cupboard.
我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下惊呆了
I opened the cupboard door and then I stood in front of it pertrified.
一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，
A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.
由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的
On sudden movement made it was sway slightly and gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me. 
我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。
Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.
这是比“骇人听闻的秘密”更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！
This is more worse than 'a terrible secret'; this is a real skeleton.
但乔治却无动于衷。
But George was unsympathetic.
“噢，是它呀！他笑着说道，俨然在谈论一位老朋友
'Oh, that!' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.
“那是塞巴斯蒂安
'That's Sebastian.
你忘了我以前是学医的了
You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time.'

尽管我们也许对我们自己的品味很自豪， 我们在选择我们想要的东西不再自由，因为广告对我们有潜移默化的影响
In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.

做广告的人在力图劝说我们买下这种产品或那种产品之前，已经仔细地研究了人的本性，并把人的弱点进行了分类
In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.
做广告的人们多年前就发现我们大家都喜欢免费得到东西
Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing.
凡是用“免费 ”这个神奇的词开头的广告很少会失败的
An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong.
目前，做广告的人不仅提供免费样品，而且还提供免费汽车，免费住房，免费周游世界
These days, advertisers not only offer free samples, but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.
他们设计数以百计的竞赛，竞赛中有人可赢得巨额奖金
They devise hundreds of competitions which will enable us to win huge sums of money.
电台、 电视使做广告的人可以用这种手段吸引成百万人的注意力
Radio and television have made it possible for advertisers to capture the attention of millions of people in this way.
有一次， 在电台播放的节目里，一个生产饼干的公司请听众烘制饼干送到他们的工厂去
During a radio programme, a company of biscuit manufacturers once asked listeners to bake biscuits and send them to their factory.
他们愿意以每磅10美元的价钱买下由听众烘制的最大的饼干
They offered to pay $10 a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener.
这次竞赛在听众中引起极其热烈的反响
The response to this competition was tremendous.
不久，形状各异，大小不一的饼干陆续送到工厂
Before long, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory.
一位女士用手推车运来一个饼干，重达500磅左右
One lady brought in a biscuit on a wheelbarrow. It weighed nearly 500 pounds.
相隔不一会儿，一个男子也带来一个大饼干，那个饼干把汽车的行李箱挤得满满的
A little later, a man came along with a big biscuit which occupied the whole boot of his car.
凡送来的饼干都仔细地称量
All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed.
最重的一个达713磅，
The largest was 713 pounds.
看来这个饼干获奖无疑了
It seemed certain that this would win the prize.
但就在竞赛截止时间将到之际，一辆卡车驶进了工厂，运来了一个特大无比、重达 2,400磅的饼干
But just before the competition closed, a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2,400 pounds.
它是由一个大学生烘制的，用去1,000多磅的面粉、800磅食糖、 200磅动物脂肪及 400磅其他各种原料
It had been baked by a college student who had used over 1,000 pounds of flour, 800 pounds of sugar, 200 pounds of flat and 400 pounds of various other ingredients.
饼干份量太重了，用了一台起重机才把它从卡车上卸下
It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.
饼干公司不得不付出比他们预计多得多的钱，因为为买下那学生烘制的饼干他们支付了24,000美元
The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated, for they bought the biscuit from the student for $2,4000.

Lesson 27 Nothing to Sell and Nothing to Buy
第27课 不买也不卖

It has been said that everyone lives by selling something.
据说每个人都要靠出售某种东西来维持生活
In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort.
根据这种说法，老师靠出售知识，哲学靠出售智慧，牧师靠出售精神慰为生
Though it may be possible to measure the value of material goods in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us.
尽管以钱来衡量货物的价值也许是可能，但人们的真正服务价值确极难估量
There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for
offering us precisely this service.
有时，我们愿意付出一切拯救我们的生命，但我们也许不愿意为外科医生细致的服务付出高额的费用
The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. 
社会情况就是这样，技术和在商店卖的货物一样需要付费
Everyone has something to sell.
人人都有东西出售
Tramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule.
流浪汉看起来这个规则中仅用的例外
Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by. 
乞丐几乎是贩卖他们本人以引起路人的同情
But real tramps are not beggars.
但真正的流浪汉不是乞丐
They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.
他们没有东西卖也不需要从别人那里买
In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity.
在寻求独立的同时，他们并不牺牲尊严
A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. 
一个流浪汉可能会向你要钱，但他从来不会要你对他感到同情
He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences.
他故意选择过着他引领的生活,并完全意识这种结果
He, may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but he is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people. 
他，也许从来不知道他们的下一顿在哪，但他们不像其它人们被千万愁事折磨
His few material possession make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease.
他们几乎没有财产,这使他们很容易从一个地方流动到另一个地方
By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do. 
因为不得不露宿街头，他比我们大多数人都更接近大自然
He may hunt, beg, or steal occasionally to keep himself alive; 
为了生存他可能会去狩猎，乞讨，或是偶尔偷窃
he may even in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. 
他甚至在真的必要时，做一些工作，但他从来不会牺牲他的自由
We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?
我们经常带着蔑视的口气说流浪汉并把他们视为乞丐一类, 但是我们有多少人能老实说，难道对他们简单生活方和自由没有一点嫉妒吗？

In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort.
虽然物质产品的价值可以用金钱来衡量，
Though it may be possible to measure the value of material goods in terms of money,
但要估算别人为我们为所提供的服务的价值却是极其困难的
it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us.
有时，我们为了挽救生命，愿意付出我们所占有的一切,
There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives,
但就在外科大夫给我们提供了这种服务后，我们却可能为所支付的昂贵的费用而抱怨
yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service.
社会上的情况就是如此，技术是必须付钱去买的，就像在商店里要花钱买商品一样

乞丐出售的几乎是他本人，以引起过路人的怜悯。
Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by.
但真正的流浪并不是乞丐。
But real tramps are not beggars.
他们既不出售任何东西，也不需要从别人那儿得到任何东西，
They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.
在追求独立自由的同时，他们并不牺牲为人的尊严
In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity.
流浪汉可能会向你讨钱，但他从来不要你可怜他。
A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him.
他是故意在选择过那种生活的，并完全清楚以这种方式生活的后果
He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences.
他可能从不知道下顿饭有无着落，但他不像有人那样被千万桩愁事所折磨。
He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but he is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people.
他几乎没有什么财产，这使他能够轻松自如地在各地奔波
His few material possession make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease.
由于被迫在露天睡觉，他比我们中许多人都离大自然近得多
By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do.
为了生存，他可能会去打猎、乞讨，偶尔偷上一两回；
He may hunt, beg, or steal occasionally to keep himself alive;
确实需要的时候，他甚至可能干一点儿活，但他决不会牺牲自由
he may even, in times of real need, do a little work, but he will never sacrifice his freedom.
说起流浪汉，我们常常带有轻蔑并把他们与乞丐归为一类, 但是，我们中有多少人能够坦率地说我们对流浪汉的简朴生活与无忧无虑的境况不感到有些羡慕呢？
We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?

确实需要的时候，他甚至可能干一点儿活，但他决不会牺牲自由
He may even, in times of real need, do a little work, but he will never sacrifice his freedom.
说起流浪汉，我们常常带有轻蔑并把他们与乞丐归为一类, 但是，我们中有多少人能够坦率地说我们对流浪汉的简朴生活与无忧无虑的境况不感到有些羡慕呢？
We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom form care?


第27课 不买也不卖
Lessson 27 Nothing to sell and nothing to buy

据说每个人都靠出售某种东西来维持生活
It has been said that everyone lives by sellig something.
根据这种说法，教师靠卖知识为生，哲学家靠卖智慧为生，牧师靠卖精神安慰为生
In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort.
虽然物质产品的价值可以用金钱来衡量，
Though it may be possible to measure the value of material goods in terms of money, 
但要估算别人为我们为所提供的服务的价值却是极其困难的
it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us.
有时，我们为了挽救生命，愿意付出我们所占有的一切,
There are times when we would willingly give everthing we possess to save our lives,
但就在外科大夫给我们提供了这种服务后，我们却可能为所支付的昂贵的费用而抱怨
yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this services.
社会上的情况就是如此，技术是必须付钱去买的，就像在商店里要花钱买商品一样
The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop.
人人都有东西可以出售
Everyone has something to sell.
在这条普遍的规律前面，好像只有流浪汉是个例外，
Tramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule.
乞丐出售的几乎是他本人，以引起过路人的怜悯。
Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by.
但真正的流浪并不是乞丐。
But real tramps are not beggars.
他们既不出售任何东西，也不需要从别人那儿得到任何东西，
They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.
在追求独立自由的同时，他们并不牺牲为人的尊严
In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice his human dignity.
流浪汉可能会向你讨钱，但他从来不要你可怜他。
A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him.
他是故意在选择过那种生活的，并完全清楚以这种方式生活的后果
He has deliberatelys chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences.
他可能从不知道下顿饭有无着落，但他不像有人那样被千万桩愁事所折磨。
He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but he is free from the thousands of enxieties which afflict other people.
他几乎没有什么财产，这使他能够轻松自如地在各地奔波
His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease.
由于被迫在露天睡觉，他比我们中许多人都离大自然近得多
By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do.
为了生存，他可能会去打猎、乞讨，偶尔偷上一两回；

那人激动地打着手势，仿佛我的出价使他不能容忍, 但他终于把价钱降到了 10英镑
Gesticulating wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous, but he eventually reduced the price to $10.
我耸耸肩膀掉头走开了,一会儿，他突然从后追了上来，把笔塞到我手里
Shrugging my shoulders, I began to walk away when, a moment later, he ran after me and thrust the pen into my hands.
虽然他绝望地举起双手，但他毫不迟疑地收下了我付给他的5 镑
Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair, he readily accepted the $5 I gave him.
在回到船上之前，我一直为我的绝妙的讨价还价而洋洋得意
I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain -- until I got back to the ship.
然而不管我如何摆弄，那枝漂亮的钢笔就是吸不进墨水来。直到今天，那枝笔连一个字也没写过！
No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single word!

第28课 五磅都嫌贵
Lesson 28 Five pounds too dear

当一艘大型班船进港的时候，许多小船载着各种杂货快速向客轮驶来
Small boats loaded with wares sped to the great liner as she was entering the harbour.
大船还未下锚。 小船上的人就纷纷爬上客轮,一会儿工夫，甲板上就摆满了色彩斑斓的波斯地毯,印度丝绸,铜咖啡壶以及手工制作的漂亮的银器
Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board and the decks were soon covered with colourful rugs from Persia, silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware.
要想不为这些东西所动心是很困难
It was difficult not to be tempted.
船上许多游客开始同商贩讨价还价起来，但我打定主意上岸之前什么也不买
Many of tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen, but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.
我刚下船，就被一个人截住，他向我兜售一枚钻石戒指
I had no sooner got off the ship than I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.
我根本不想买，但我不能掩饰这样一个事实：其钻石之大给我留下了深刻的印象
I had no intention of buying one, but I could not conceal the fact that I was impresssed by the size of the diamonds.
有的钻石像玻璃球那么大
Some of them were as big as marbles.
那人竭力想证明那钻石是真货
The man went to great lengths to prove that the diamonds were real.
我们路过一家商店时，他将一颗钻石使劲地往橱窗上一按，在玻璃上留下一道深痕
As we were walking past a shop, he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass.
我花了半个多小时才摆脱了他的纠缠
It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.
向我兜售的第二个人是卖名贵钢笔和手表的
The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.
我仔细察看了一枝钢笔，
I examined one of the pens closely.
那看上去确实不假，
It certainly looked genuine.
金笔帽下方整齐地刻有 “美国制造 ”字样
At the base of the gold cap, the words "made in the U.S.A" had been neatly inscribed.
那人说那支笔值50英镑，作为特别优惠，他愿意让我出30英镑成交
The man said that the pen was worth $50, but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30.
我摇摇头，伸出 5 根手指表示我只愿出5 镑
I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $5.
那人激动地打着手势，仿佛我的出价使他不能容忍, 但他终于把价钱降到了 10英镑
